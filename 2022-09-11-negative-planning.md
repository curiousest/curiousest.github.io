# Plan when not to follow a habit

Say you have a good habit like, *"I go to the gym regularly."* To set up the habit for success, plan when you're **not** going to do it. 

### opt-in

When I have the mindset, "go to the gym 4x/week", and I'm making that same decisions, this is how I will think:

"Going to the gym is something I should do. It will make me a better person. Should I put the effort in and go today?"

### opt-out

When I have the mindset, "skip the gym 3x/week", and I'm deciding whether, today, I should go to the gym, this is how I will think:

"I normally go to the gym. Has it been 4x yet this week? No. Is there any significant reason why I shouldn't? No."

They're the same decision with different framing. One framing takes willpower and the other doesn't. One mindset is aspirational and the other is autopilot. Of course, both need reasonable goals - neither of these will work: "never skip the gym" and "go to the gym every day".

## "evidence"
I'm in the middle of reading two things:
- Ray Dalio's Principles
- HBR March-April 2022

There's an HBR article that references [this research](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/47/6/1003/5918032). It's about framing goals. It claims the framing, "skip the gym 3x/week" is more successful than "go to the gym 4x/week".

Ray Dalio's Principles has [a section](https://www.principles.com/principles/1f2a26ba-daca-4c6c-95d3-0cf33bd8454f/) that talks about the logical vs. emotional decision-making. It seems in line with what I've read elsewhere, like the book "Thinking Fast and Slow". We make lots of "emotional" or "gut" or "lower-level" decisions. That non-logical side of us is portrayed as lazy and clever.
