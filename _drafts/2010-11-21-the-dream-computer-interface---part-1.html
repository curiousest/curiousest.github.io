Half 1: Deep in Dream<br />Dreams are magical and everyone knows it. Every sleep, our brains construct a universe where we exist for a series of fleeting events that are mostly forgotten. Most people treat these phenomena like a movie: observing and feeling a part of the piece without making any decisions - and why wouldn't you? It requires no effort, they're often entertaining, and always personally relevant. I didn't even know there was anything else you could do with dreams until a few years ago.<br />Some people consciously interact with their universes. They are capable of becoming conscious of the fact that they are dreaming in the midst of a dream. Dreams where the dreamer is conscious of the fact that they are dreaming are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming">lucid dreams</a>, and dreamers who explore their dreaming universes are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneironaut">oneironauts</a>. Some people have lucid dreams and some people never do - I never had one until I tried.<br /><br />Lucid dreams are wonderful and immersive to the point that it is very difficult to relate to the outside world. All the fantastic events still find their way into your universe, but you get some control over what happens. You can make conscious decisions and your brain fills in the rest. Since you're conscious, you can consider and interact with the outside world, but only with the right tools.<br /><br />Half 2: Talk Thoughts<br />One thing that computers aren't particularly good at doing is interacting with humans. There is a great deal of research going on in the field of natural user interfaces, and it's being realized by consumer devices like touchscreens, the Wii and Microsoft Kinect. One particularly interesting human-computer interface is the BCI (brain-computer interface). Consumer BCIs are mostly non-invasive headsets that use EEG measurements on the scalp of the user to "detect thoughts."
