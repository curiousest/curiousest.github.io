WORK IN PROGRESS

define: trust: firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something.

A "firm belief" does not mean that the belief is there is a 100% chancce that it will happen. That if it happens, there doesn't happen, there is some physical flaw in the universe. A "firm belief" means that there is some chance, however small, that it may not happen.

Let's say thereis a very small chanc

That small chance that your trust is unfulfilled and the thing happens that you trusted wouldn't happen is some percentage chance. There's some probability that it will occur. Let's assign that probability to X.

Ex: say you're 99% certain you passed the exam. That means there's a 1% chance you didn;t.

The cost of your trust is:

The cost of getting into a position where you're made the likelihood of failure as small as possible
The cost of failure multiplied by the chance that your trust will be broken (X x cost of failure)
Ex: say the cost fo failing your exam is $100 + half of your study time wasted. That means the cost of your trust that you will pass is 1% x ($100 + half of your stud y time) = $1 + 0.05x study time

Brands that your trust can charge significant markup because that markup is worth the difference in cost between the brancd and an untrausted brand which has a cost of trust.

When we design systems, we and societies, we design them in a way where:

The trust is maximized
The cost of maximizing that trust is miinimized
The cost of failure is minimized
Often the cost of failure (that the trust is broken) is fixed and can't be minimized much.

Of societies:
Westen societies put a great deal of trust in law and judicial branches of government. We incur significant cost to set up the laws correctly and ensure those laws are enforced. Deals between companies or individuals are made by contracts which can be upheld in a court of law. It is often clear what the cost of feailure---

In Chinese societies, a great deal of trust is put in guanxi - relationships, a moral obligation to maintain them, and face (social status & prestige). It takes a great deal of effort and cost to acquire guanxi, but once you have it, you have the trust of others. When a deal is made between two parties that don't know each other well, a third party will put up their guanxi as collateral to ensure the deal goes through smoothly. If either side doesn't follow through, the third party loses face & relationships (guanxi), which causes the reneging party to also lose guanxi.For the thrid party to risk their guanxi, they will often be compensated. 

In the context of sharing personal information, trust is complex. Let's say you share some sensitive information with a business in exchange for free services. That information can likely be shared with other businessse *will be in exchange for value (money or services, etc). The next party may share that with another, etc. At some point, some party may use that information in a way that negatively affects you. (it may be stolen from some business along the way too) Because information is so easy to share , there's a big chance that it has spread significantly. The cost chance that it will be used against you increases every time it is shared further. That means, despite the low chance that the first party uses it to your detriment, there's a hidden chance the that information is shared to the point that theres a high chance it's used to your detriment. Because of thise, there's high uncertainty as to the actual risk of trust-infringement when sharing person al information.

Blockchain systems are trustless insomuch that you don't have to trust a third party when using them. You do have to trust:

Your ability to understand the system or contracts being executed within the system
That the system works in practcie
That the assumptions of the system hold. Ex: RSA encryption doesn't get broekn, 50% hashing Arguable boyth of those points are indevelopment and being constantly improvedd. Unlike centralized banks or courts of law, one can be certain that the contracts won't change , and can be certain of how the rulings will be enforced before different conditions happen.
