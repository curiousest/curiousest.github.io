WORK IN PROGRESS

With every passing conscious moment, you are making a choice. You may decide to continue acting on a previous choice: to continue reading this sentence. You may choose to stop at any word until the end.

Every choice between alternatives means you optimized for some outcome. Even picking randomly is optimizing for randomness. It is impossible to not optimize for something, in every decision you make, in every conscious moment. The outcomes you desire, the things you're optimizing for, change moment to moment, day to day, decade to decade - and your choices reflect those changes in desire.

Every moment, you're making a choice in order to optimize for some outcome. It's impossible not to. You may make one big choice, then follow with a multitude of smaller choices.

## So what are you optimizing for?

An idea you can't unthink. 

You're always optimizing for something, but you have a degree of control over what you're optimizing for. You can select high-level things you want to optimize for, then make microdecisions stemming from those. You can choose to have no purpose other than to react to your bodily needs. In practice, your purpose is shaped by your environment and experience - peers, society, body, etc. You still have an active part in choosing your purpose. Even choosing to make every decision random has to have a reason behind it.

You are intentional in everything you do. Your every moment has purpose, whether you actively guide it or not. IMO you should actively guide it, and that's why I think self-control is extremely important, because it enables you to maintain the high-level purpose you chose.
