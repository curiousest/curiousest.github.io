Most of the development time spent on a non-greenfield software product (claim review) is making sure we don't break any other features when we add new ones. 

It is low effort to guarantee that a graph/analysis/etc will work the day after you make it.
It is high continuous product team effort to guarantee that a graph/analysis/etc will work continuously after it's made. And that continuous effort scales with the number of different graphs/analyses/etc that are made.
Our internal reporting will need similar guarantees, but they are orders of magnitude less strict than "live customer access".

Reporting is definitely not a core competency, and if customers have deep individualized reporting needs we should probably consider buy vs. invest heavy product dev. Is now the right time to make that decision? To what degree do we prioritize faster product development vs customizability to individual customers?
