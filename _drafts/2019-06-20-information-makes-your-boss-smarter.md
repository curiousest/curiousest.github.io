Initial suspicions: my boss, developing superpowers
---
I worked at a tech startup from seed stage past series B, and my manager was the CTO. As time passed and the company grew in headcount, my boss grew too. I watched as my boss, as far as I could tell, aquired more intellect and social powers. He is a truly great person, but I felt those realized powers were greater than his inherent abilities - there were lots of smart people and sociable people at the company, but he stood out and was celebrated for it. It made sense for him to have elevated social power in an executive position, but the apparent increase in intelligence didn't make sense to me. <describe what I mean by "intelligence"?>

Describe how I became a manager and started to get superpowers
I'm the boss, developing superpowers

Describe Raz + panel HiL

When you see someone above you in a management structure, and they seem far more intelligent, and you're considering how much respect to have for them (how much you could learn from them). Have a think: is it because they have more company context? Is it because they have more long-term experience / inherent ability?
When you see people looking up to you for guidance/decision-making/mentorship, is it because you have more context? ability? experience?

Is short term information gained by being in a company "better" than "long term experience"?

"Isn't experience just information asymetry?"
