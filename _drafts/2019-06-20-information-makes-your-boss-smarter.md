Initial suspicions: my boss, developing superpowers
---
I worked at a tech startup from seed stage past series B, and my manager was the CTO. As time passed and the company grew in headcount, my boss grew too. I watched as my boss, as far as I could tell, aquired more intellect and social powers. He is a truly great person, but I felt those realized powers were greater than his inherent abilities - there were lots of smart people and sociable people at the company, but he stood out and was celebrated for it. It made sense for him to have elevated social power in an executive position, but the apparent increase in intelligence didn't make sense to me. <describe what I mean by "intelligence"?>

Describe how I became a manager and started to get superpowers
I'm the boss, developing superpowers

As time passed and the developer team grew, I was put both in both management and individual leadership positions. I had encyclopedic knowledge of the technical system and product. I had seniority and had interviewed our new joiners. I noticed that as a leader in an individual contributor capacity, I got the impression that people thought I was really smart. Whatever question they had about the system or technology, I had a decent answer to off the top of my head. In group contexts, my opinions carried great weight, and confidently saying anything reasonable snowballed my social capital. I was self-confident, but I clearly knew I didn't have skill/intelligence that was multiples of others. My output per unit of effort was, though. And it was obvious to me that it was mostly due to accumulated information. To make the company more productive, I chose to switch to distributing information instead of individual productivity. 

As a leader in a management capacity, I got the impression that people thought I was really wise. Whatever concern they had, after talking through it with me, they felt a bit better and respected me more.


Describe how one developer after another became "only dev on project" and regardless of their skill/temperment, became a big influencer.

Describe Adrien + conversation with Janto.
---
I was talking with a researcher/developer on another product. He had just been in a product steering meeting. A business-oriented co-founder had joined the steering meeting for that product for the first time. My colleague described in amazement,

Colleague: "It was incredible. He had so much...............  He can go into so much detail on random facets - product, research, business, operations...
Me: "Yes, he's similar in our product steering meetings. I think a big part of it is he has all the information. He knows the involvement and ability of everyone in the company. He knows what customers want/need from the product. He knows...

Colleague: "Yeah that makes sense. On top of that he's also incredibly capable."

Me: "Agreed."


Describe pairing with Gui, "yeah, it's way easier to build stuff when you're pairing with a talking encyclopedia of the product&codebase."



My boss' boss: solving very hard problems
Describe Raz + panel HiL
---

At a different company, my product was facing a very difficult problem. We had been using a half-way working solution to the problem for a while, but the 50% of the time it didn't work had a very high cost. Several engineers, myself included, had been long considering how to make significant improvements, but all the options seemed to be big technical investments that we couldn't really make at the time. My boss' boss, the CTO, was familiar with the problem but not the current solution. He asked for the codebase and a brief overview. He came back the next week with an answer:
CTO: "I took a look at the code. There's some minor improvements we could make to what's there, but I don't see major improvement opportunities."
Me: "Yup"
CTO: "We can solve the problem a different way, though. The non-tech team XYZ can take ownership of this problem."
Me: "Wouldn't that be a big, continuous effort for them?"
CTO: "Yes, but it's better than any alternative. I talked to XYZ team lead, and they're onboard."

This didn't even register as a possibility - to give another team an order of magnitude more work than it would take our team to solve the same problem. I didn't know the inner workings or priorities of the other team. I didn't even know that the other team had the ability to solve this problem.


When you see someone above you in a management structure, and they seem far more intelligent, and you're considering how much respect to have for them (how much you could learn from them). Have a think: is it because they have more company context? Is it because they have more long-term experience / inherent ability?
When you see people looking up to you for guidance/decision-making/mentorship, is it because you have more context? ability? experience?

Is short term information gained by being in a company "better" than "long term experience"?

"Isn't experience just information asymetry?"
