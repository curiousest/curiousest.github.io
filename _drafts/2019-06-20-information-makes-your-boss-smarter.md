<h3>Initial suspicions: my boss, developing superpowers</h3>

I worked at a tech startup from seed stage past series B and my manager was the CTO. As the company grew in headcount, my boss grew too. I watched as my boss, as far as I could tell, gained more intellect and social powers. He is a truly great person, but I felt those realized powers were greater than his inherent abilities - there were lots of smart people and sociable people at the company, but he stood out and was celebrated for it in a cult-like fashion. It made sense for him to have elevated social power in an executive position, but the rapid increase in overall ability/intelligence didn't make sense to me...

<h3>I'm the expert, developing superpowers</h3>

As time passed and the developer team grew, I was put both in both management and individual leadership positions. I had encyclopedic knowledge of the technical system and product. I had seniority and interviewed/onboarded all of our product team's new joiners. By virtue of being a leader in an individual contributor capacity, my colleagues thought I was really smart. Whatever question they had about the system or technology, I could answer off the top of my head. In group contexts, my opinions carried almost unchallengeable weight, and confidently saying anything reasonable snowballed my perceived competence and social capital. I knew my skill/intelligence was not 10x others, but my output per unit of effort was. It became clear to me that the discrepancy between my productivity and other individual contributors' was mostly due to accumulated company-specific information. To make the company more productive, I chose emphasize improving others' productive output instead of maximizing mine.

As a leader in a management capacity, I got the impression that people thought I was really wise. Whatever concern they had, after talking through it with me, they felt a bit better and respected me more.

<h3>Successive developers with superpowers</h3>

Fast-forward to another tech startup where I fulfilled a combination of product management and technical program management roles on a product. Over the course of my involvement, four successive developers found themselves in the position of having the deepest understanding of the technical system comprising the product. I noticed some patterns.

//Tell it like a story about one developer: 

The given "developer with deepest understanding of the system" had *real organizational power*. They had the greatest influence over the velocity of product improvements (even though they may not have understood this). No one would debate any decision they made unless it was extreme on the surface. They were perceived as high performers. Notably, this influence and respect was granted independent of ability. Each successive developer was the only realistic individual that could have been the "developer with deepest understanding" - there was no other options, so their power was situationally imposed. None of these developers put in concentrated effort to help the next developer(s) understand the system - they continued the practice of siloing this information. 


//Imply this, don't write the thesis
In summary, individuals were granted organizational power by being in the right place at the right time, and held this power by collecting unshared information (technical system knowledge).

<h3>Co-founder with effortless expertise</h3>

I was talking with a developer on another product. He had just been in a product steering meeting. The business-oriented co-founder had joined the steering meeting for that product for the first time. My colleague described in amazement,

Colleague: "It was incredible. He had so much...............  He can go into so much detail on random facets - product, research, business, operations...
Me: "Yes, he's similar in our product steering meetings. I think a big part of it is he has all the information. He knows the involvement and ability of everyone in the company. He knows what customers want/need from the product. He vaguely understands engineering limitations and how the research team does their work.

Colleague: "Yeah that makes sense."

A contemplative pause...

Colleague: "He's stil incredible."

Me: "Agreed."

Describe pairing with Gui, "yeah, it's way easier to build stuff when you're pairing with a talking encyclopedia of the every product decision & codebase implications."

<h3>My boss' boss: solving very hard problems</h3>


At a different company, my product was facing a very difficult problem. We had been using a half-way working solution to the problem for a while, but the 50% of the time it didn't work had a very high cost. Several engineers, myself included, had been long considering how to make significant improvements, but all the options seemed to be big technical investments that we couldn't really make at the time. My boss' boss, the CTO, was familiar with the problem but not the current solution. He asked for the codebase and a brief overview. He reviewed it over the the weekend and came back the next week with the solution:

CTO: "I took a look at the code. It's a bit strange and there's some minor improvements we could make to what's there, but I don't see major improvement opportunities."

Me: "Yup."

CTO: "We can solve the problem a different way, though. The non-tech team XYZ can take ownership of this problem."

Me: "Wouldn't that be a big, continuous effort for them?"

CTO: "Yes, but it's better than any alternative. I talked to XYZ team lead, and they're onboard."

This didn't even register as a possibility to me - to give a whole product problem to another non-technical team who would solve it in a way that would take and order of magnitude more effort than it would take our team to solve. I didn't know the inner workings or priorities of the other team. I didn't even know that the other team had the ability to solve this problem. The experience was humbling.


When you see someone above you in a management structure, and they seem far more intelligent, and you're considering how much respect to have for them (how much you could learn from them). Have a think: is it because they have more company context? Is it because they have more long-term experience / inherent ability?
When you see people looking up to you for guidance/decision-making/mentorship, is it because you have more context? ability? experience?

Is short term information gained by being in a company "better" than "long term experience"?

"Isn't experience just information asymetry?"
