### Exposition

Ding! Ding! Ding!

A bell rings inches from the window. It's 5am. I unstick my dry tongue from it's perch on the roof of my mouth. The room I woke up in is filled with seven other men in bunk beds. We're tired and silent. We line up to leave the room. There are five other rooms along the hall. We line up for the urinals. We line up to leave the building for the frigid outside. We line up to enter the lecture room. It's dead silent - no rustling leaves or wind. We sit in lines making up a grid.

We're in meditation camp.  

### Reflection on previous times I did meditation.

I once did a 10-day vippassana meditation camp in Bangalore and learned so much. 

I learned that a useful kind of meditation is expressing equanimity in the face of cravings and aversions resulting from focusing on awareness of breath in a still and unstimulated posture.
I learned that expressing equanimity is accepting that you are experiencing cravings or aversions, but not taking actions on them.
Where cravings are good-feeling things that you want to feel. And aversions are bad-feeling things that you want to stop feeling.

From that experience, I came to a mental model.

You have a tank of willpower. You use up willpower when you have to be intentional about things / do things that you don't naturally want to do. When you're low on willpower, you're much less likely to do things that are an optimal decision from your longer-term perspective. You're more likely to make impulsive decisions that satisfy your instinctive immediate desires (cravings) or quash your instinctive immediate pains (aversions).
Meditation increases the capacity of your willpower tank by training those "mental muscles" involved in making these willpower-requiring decisions.

Example: 
When I eat a meal at home, I watch a Netflix episode or a pro-gaming game on YouTube. I find that consuming Netflix episodes and pro-gaming content is unproductive and not aligned with my goals. I find that I spend more time on the combined activities of preparing food / eating / consuming media content because the episodes are much longer than it takes to eat and I don't want to stop halfway through. I want to spend my time on something else. Meditation builds my willpower so I can regularly make a "better" decision in this situation - to stop earlier, not watch anything in the first place, etc.

How this is flawed:
- Meditation doesn't enable you to make better decisions? That's suspicious.
- How is this different than overall energy and how tired you are?

But this time, X years later, I did a 4-day meditation camp in Suffolk, England. I came out with a different mental model.

### Exposition: struggle/complaining

No food after noon. I'm trying to gain muscle mass, and we're having two small vegetarian meals/day, less than 2000 calories. 3000 calories/day isn't even what I need to maintain what I have.

### Exposition: walking in circles breakthrough, socratic questioning

There's a large grassy area where the men walk in circles, clockwise. The grass bends forwards. A loop takes five to ten minutes at a contemplative pace, and I'm contemplative.

The willpower tank analogy is flawed. I feel like meditation enables you to make better decisions, even in times of low willpower. If meditation just makes the willpower tank bigger, it wouldn't help times of low willpower. So what is it doing?

It's a practice. What skill am I practicing? I sit still, I concentrate on sensory experiences, my mind wanders, I catch my mind and accept the small failure, I reflect on the failure, I let it go to resume concentrating.

It sounds like I'm practicing awareness of my mind fleeting uncontrolled and concentrating on sensory experiences. I'm practicing accepting what I uncontrollably think and feel, but more importantly, I practice not taking action on the things I uncontrollably think and feel.

Unexpected events happen and I notice them. Then I choose what action to take on those unexpected events.

What if we are complex distributed systems? Complex distributed systems exhibit behaviours that are hard to deal with. Sometimes those behaviours are useful and we want more of them, sometimes those behaviours are harmful and we want less of them. The first step to adjusting those behaviours is to observe them. The second step is to modify them or complement them with other behaviours?

Meditation is a practice that gives you tools to debug yourself. You practice observing unexpected behaviours. You practice mitigating those unexpected behaviours. With those skills, you can identify the behaviours you want to exhibit more or less of, then make the desired change.

Moreover, other people are complex distributed systems. The practice observing yourself must translate to observing others. Identifying the root cause of the behaviours they exhibit.

The tools it gives you make you more effective at inspecting the symptoms of emergent behaviours and tracing them back to the root causes of the behaviours so that you can treat those root causes. 

### Explaining deeper: observability?




Example:
When I eat a meal at home, I watch a Netflix episode or a pro-gaming game on YouTube. I find that consuming Netflix episodes and pro-gaming content is unproductive and not aligned with my goals. I want to spend my time on something else, but I find that breaking this pattern is very difficult.

***estimate of amount of this content I've consumed + details of what video games, etc.

With the meditation tools, I am more aware of the cravings I experience - when I eat at home, I crave episodal video content and when I watch episodal video content at home, I crave food. In particular, meditation makes me more aware in the moment. Because I'm more aware that I'm experiencing a craving, I have a greater opportunity to make the decision more intentionally - to make the long-term-optimal decision.

Because I have a better recollection of how frequently and how intensely I'm experiencing this craving, I realized that using willpower to decouple eating and consuming episodal video content was not going to work - I was going to have to take premeditated preventative actions. I identified a replacement - podcasts. It replaced my unproductive passive consumption with slightly productive passive consumption and it reduced the amount of time I spent on the combined activities of preparing food / eating / consuming media content.

How this is flawed:

- IDK yet?
- Not convincing enough?
