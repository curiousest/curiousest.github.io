no food after 12 noon. I'm trying to gain mass, and 3000 calories/day isn't even maintenance calories. we're having two meals/day, < 2000 calories


Vipassana meditation: expressing equanimity in the face of cravings and aversions resulting from focusing on awareness of breath in a still and unstimulated posture.
Expressing equanimity: accepting that you are experiencing cravings or aversions, but not submitting to them
Cravings: good-feeling things that you want to feel
Aversions: bad-feeling things that you want to stop feeling

Before coming to this camp, I had one mental model about the utility of meditation. I left with a new mental model.

Before the camp mental model:
You have a tank of willpower. You use up willpower when you have to be intentional about things / do things that you don't naturally want to do. When you're low on willpower, you're much less likely to do things that are an optimal decision from your longer-term perspective. You're more likely to make impulsive decisions that satisfy your instinctive immediate desires (cravings) or quash your instinctive immediate pains (aversions).
Meditation increases the capacity of your willpower tank by training those "mental muscles" involved in making these willpower-requiring decisions.

Example: 
When I eat a meal at home, I watch a Netflix episode or a pro-gaming game on YouTube. I find that consuming Netflix episodes and pro-gaming content is unproductive and not aligned with my goals. I find that I spend more time on the combined activities of preparing food / eating / consuming media content because the episodes are much longer than it takes to eat and I don't want to stop halfway through. I want to spend my time on something else. Meditation builds my willpower so I can regularly make a "better" decision in this situation - to stop earlier, not watch anything in the first place, etc.

How this is flawed:
- Meditation doesn't enable you to make better decisions? That's suspicious.
- How is this different than overall energy and how tired you are?

After the camp mental model:

Suppose people are complex distributed systems. You are a complex distributed system. Complex distributed systems exhibit behaviours that are complex to debug. Meditation is a practice that gives you tools to debug yourself. The tools it gives you make you more effective at inspecting the symptoms of emergent behaviours and tracing them back to the root causes of the behaviours so that you can treat those root causes. 

Example:
When I eat a meal at home, I watch a Netflix episode or a pro-gaming game on YouTube. I find that consuming Netflix episodes and pro-gaming content is unproductive and not aligned with my goals. I want to spend my time on something else, but I find that breaking this pattern is very difficult.

***estimate of amount of this content I've consumed + details of what video games, etc.

With the meditation tools, I am more aware of the cravings I experience - when I eat at home, I crave episodal video content and when I watch episodal video content at home, I crave food. In particular, meditation makes me more aware in the moment. Because I'm more aware that I'm experiencing a craving, I have a greater opportunity to make the decision more intentionally - to make the long-term-optimal decision.

Because I have a better recollection of how frequently and how intensely I'm experiencing this craving, I realized that using willpower to decouple eating and consuming episodal video content was not going to work - I was going to have to take premeditated preventative actions. I identified a replacement - podcasts. It replaced my unproductive passive consumption with slightly productive passive consumption and it reduced the amount of time I spent on the combined activities of preparing food / eating / consuming media content.

How this is flawed:

- IDK yet?
- Not convincing enough?
