Ding! Ding! Ding!

A bell rings inches from the window. It's 5am. I unstick my dry tongue from it's perch on the roof of my mouth. The room I woke up in is filled with seven other men in bunk beds. We're tired and silent. We line up to leave the room, one of five along the hall. We line up for the urinals. We line up to leave the building, outside is cold, crisp, and asleep - no wind or rustling leaves. We line up to enter the lecture room. We line up in a grid, sitting, waiting for waiting's sake.

We're in meditation camp.

[Part 1](/vipassana-1) | [Part 2](/vipassana-2) | [Part 3](/vipassana-3) | **Part 4**

#### Once upon a time

I did a 10-day vippassana meditation camp in Bangalore and learned so much.

I learned that a useful kind of meditation is practicing equanimity in the face of cravings and aversions resulting from focusing on awareness of breath in a still and unstimulated posture.

That expressing equanimity is accepting that you are experiencing cravings or aversions, but not taking actions on them.

That cravings are good-feeling things that you want to feel. And aversions are bad-feeling things that you want to not feel.

#### I arrived at a mental model.

(Willpower tank drawing. Lifting weights to build the tank.)

I have a tank of willpower. I use up willpower when I act against my cravings or aversions, doing things that wouldn't be my default choice. When I'm low on willpower, I'm more likely to make impulsive decisions that satisfy my instinctive immediate desires. I'm less likely to make the best short-term decisions for my long-term goals. Meditation increases the capacity of my willpower tank by training those "mental muscles" involved in making willpower-requiring decisions.

#### But the mental model was flawed

How this is flawed:
- Meditation doesn't enable you to make better decisions? Doesn't make you wiser? That's suspicious.
- How is this different than overall energy and how tired you are?

But this time, X years later, I did a 4-day meditation camp in Suffolk, England. I came out with a different mental model.

### Exposition: struggle/complaining

No food after noon. I've been trying to gain muscle mass lately, but we're having two small vegetarian meals each day, less than 2000 calories. 3400 calories is what I need to maintain what I have. I must take my mind off hunger. I walk.

### Exposition: walking in circles breakthrough, socratic questioning

There's a large grassy area where the men walk in circles, clockwise. The grass bends forwards. A loop takes five to ten minutes at a contemplative pace, and I'm contemplative.

I feel like the willpower tank analogy is flawed. Meditation helps me make better decisions, even in times of low willpower. If meditation just makes the willpower tank bigger, it wouldn't help times of low willpower. So what is it doing?

It's a practice. What skill am I practicing? What do I do when I meditate? I sit still, concentrate on sensory experiences, but my mind wanders. I catch it, accept the small failure, reflect on the failure, then ease back into concentration.

It's like I'm practicing awareness of my mind fleeting uncontrolled and concentrating on sensory experiences. I'm practicing accepting what I uncontrollably think and feel, but more importantly, I practice not taking action on the things I uncontrollably think and feel. I'm practicing being an objective observer of myself. That feels like the right direction to explore. Why are objective observers useful?

Unexpected events happen and I notice them. I analyze where they came from, then I use all this information to choose what action to take.

What if I am like a complex distributed system? Complex distributed systems have properties that are hard to deal with. They exhibit emergent behaviours that are difficult to diagnose, because they stem from several underlying causes that combine in unexpected ways. Sometimes those behaviours are useful and we want more of them, sometimes those behaviours are harmful and we want less of them. The first step to adjusting those emergent behaviours is to observe them and identify underlying causes. Then I can address root causes instead of treating symptoms.

---

#### And I came to a new mental model

Meditation is a practice that gives you tools to debug yourself. You practice observing unexpected behaviours. You practice mitigating those unexpected behaviours. With those skills, you can identify the behaviours you want to exhibit more or less of, then make the desired change.

(drawing, brain-shaped gears and machine, fire -> meditative magnifying glass reveals rube-goldberg-causation. Sparking broken wires x gas spill? )

Moreover, other people are complex distributed systems. The practice observing yourself must translate to observing others. Identifying the root cause of the behaviours they exhibit.

The tools it gives you make you more effective at inspecting the symptoms of emergent behaviours and tracing them back to the root causes of the behaviours so that you can treat those root causes. 

### Explaining deeper: observability?

Explore observability in tech and draw parallels


Example:
When I eat a meal at home, I watch a Netflix episode or a pro-gaming game on YouTube. I find that consuming Netflix episodes and pro-gaming content is unproductive and not aligned with my goals. I want to spend my time on something else, but I find that breaking this pattern is very difficult.

***estimate of amount of this content I've consumed + details of what video games, etc.

With the meditation tools, I am more aware of the cravings I experience - when I eat at home, I crave episodal video content and when I watch episodal video content at home, I crave food. In particular, meditation makes me more aware in the moment. Because I'm more aware that I'm experiencing a craving, I have a greater opportunity to make the decision more intentionally - to make the long-term-optimal decision.

Because I have a better recollection of how frequently and how intensely I'm experiencing this craving, I realized that using willpower to decouple eating and consuming episodal video content was not going to work - I was going to have to take premeditated preventative actions. I identified a replacement - podcasts. It replaced my unproductive passive consumption with slightly productive passive consumption and it reduced the amount of time I spent on the combined activities of preparing food / eating / consuming media content.

How this is flawed:

- IDK yet?
- Not convincing enough?
