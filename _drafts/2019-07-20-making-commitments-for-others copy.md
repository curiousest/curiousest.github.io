<h3></h3>
Many people in companies don't have the awareness that they can reject commitments made by others to them. Making commitments should involve clarification, back-and-forth, negotiation, etc.

It's easy to make commitments. It's hard to meet them.
=> It's easy to make commitments, then make those commitments someone else's problem.

If you're not an expert in all the areas where commitments were made, you don't know what you're committing to.
