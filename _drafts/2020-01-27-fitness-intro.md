I grew up playing most sports and eating healthy. Despite that, I made mistakes when I tried to get fit and be more attractive. It's easy to screw up improving your fitness, but it's easy to do well too - you need a breadth of simple knowledge. This is the article I wish I had when I started intentionally improving my fitness.

## 80% of my advice

"Fitness" covers three areas where you may want to improve your body: aesthetics, health, and functional fitness. Those areas have high overlap, but they require focusing your effort on different things. You can be toned and unhealthy. You can be a flabby olympian. You can be perfectly healthy and otherwise mediocre.

Regardless of your goals, diet is the most important topic to focus effort on. Exercise is second. You will have to spend time learning and building habits in both topics - focusing on one and not the other will slow your progress.

I couldn't find trustworthy diet information on the internet. The fastest way to get a foundation is to spend a few hours learning from a professional: a dietician or personal trainer. After that, experiment with different approaches to your diet and measure results.

## The last 20% that won't be found via self-study

### Count calories

So much of diet centers around controlling the calories/protein you eat and the calories you burn. This was the biggest failure in my fitness journey.

#### How do you find these numbers?

It's hard. Either track everything you eat for a week (use [myfitnesspal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/search)) or decide in advance everything you will eat and add up the calories. Track your weight over that week to measure calories burned.

#### How accurate do the measurements have to be?

It's up to you, but here's a rough guide.

One kilogram of bodyfat allegedly takes 7700 calories to burn off. If you eat 7700 calories extra, you won't gain one kilogram of bodyfat, but it's the right order of magnitude. If your measurements are 1000 calories off, it's around 0.13 kilograms of bodyfat.

A red bell pepper has ~31 calories, a carrot has ~41 calories, and an apple has ~52 calories. A cup of rice has 200 calories, a mars bar has 228 calories, and half a box of ritz crackers has 1120 calories. 20% error on 200 calories is the same as forgetting a whole fruit or vegetable. Forgetting a candy bar is like forgetting a picnic of fruits and vegetables. Expend effort where it matters - know what's calorie-dense and track it carefully.

### Learn from people IRL

Exercise is a simple topic, but slow to learn on your own. That makes it a great topic to learn from amateurs. Find a peer group that pushes you to learn and improve. Weightlifting buddies and technique-focused group weightlifting classes are fun learning opportunities. Personal trainers and dieticians are expensive, so you're not going to spend a lot of time with them. Use them to teach you the fundementals or advanced knowledge - the vast middle is best filled by others.

### Always look good

In the 10-15% bodyfat range, men look great. There's a desirable range for women too. Lose fat until you look good, then do bulk/cut cycles in that range to stay looking good. All goals require building or maintaining muscle with strength exercises (including losing fat). The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn. Cardio and conditioning barely build or maintain muscle, but they are good for your health and burn lots of calories.

### Fitness effort complements office work effort

After working in an office 9am-5pm, it's hard to do more white-collar work. You can exercise, though. They are different, complementary efforts. You can pursue goals in both areas of life with low conflict.
