[Required pre-reading, on a problem/solution framework](/how-i-speak-product.html)

Delegation means you describe a problem as ask someone else to be responsible for all downstream solutions and problems.

The higher up the tree of problems, the larger the responsibility that you're delegating.

Presenting a vision to someone and delegating a piece of that is clarifying a set of problems and solutions.

"How can I implement my manager's solution to problem X?" becomes the new problem. That problem introduces new costs like paying attention to how closely I follow my manager's solution (as opposed to how well I'm solving problem X).

Handing someone a solution to implement instead of a problem means you don't have the time or skill to sufficiently explain the problem.
