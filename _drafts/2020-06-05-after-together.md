I'm in the moment with you.

<closeup face no shoulders, serious face, staring into camera pic>

---

_Minutes later,_ we're not together,

But I'm warm in the afterglow.

<face and chest, walking looking sideways in happy thought.>

I recall your scent.

---

_Days later,_ those feelings have dissipated,

But new ones are born in the space between us.

<whole loveseat fullbody, lying down relaxed clothes feet up in the sun balcony serious face contemplating>

I recall your gaze.

---

_Weeks later,_ those feelings have faded too,

But they're still within reach - I weave in and out of them.

<1/2 - 1/4 body size in frame, picture... remembering?>

I recall your face.

---

_Months later,_ those feelings are forgotten,

But I remember that you made me feel.

<1/10th body in frame in motion, somewhere with feeling of scale>

I recall your name.
