I'm in the moment with you.

<closeup face no shoulders, serious face, staring into camera pic>

---

_Minutes later,_ we're not together,

But I'm warm in the afterglow.

<face and chest, walking looking sideways in happy thought.>

I remember your scent.

---

_Days later,_ my feelings have run their course,

But new ones are born in the space between us.

<whole loveseat fullbody, lying down relaxed clothes feet up in the sun balcony serious face contemplating>

I remember your touch.

---

_Weeks later,_ my new feelings have faded too,

But they're all still within reach - I weave in and out of them.

<1/2 - 1/4 body size in frame, picture... remembering?>

I remember your face.

---

_Months later,_ my feelings have been forgotten,

But I know _that_ you made me feel.

<1/10th body in frame in motion, somewhere with feeling of scale>

I remember your name.
