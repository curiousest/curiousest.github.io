## Debugging

I used to think meditation was a tool to train willpower. I used to say things like, "Willpower is a tank that empties. I meditate to make the tank bigger." People who meditate seem to do all the "right" things effortlessly. They don't do the things they shouldn't. They seem to have more willpower. Correlation.

Now I think it improves my powers of self-observation. When I know what's really going on inside, I can debug my habits.

> People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. Itâ€™s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
> *- Atomic habits*

My habits falter all the time - I haven't meditated in a month! I start from my goals. What goal am I trying to achieve with this habit? Is this goal really a priority right now? Am I overreaching? If I want to fix this failing habit, I introspect for a while and think about what to change (easy/attractive). If the habit is important and likely to fail, I track it by checking it off every day.
