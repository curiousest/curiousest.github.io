In a previous job I was onboarding a senior product person. I complained that some important task wasn't one of my responsibilities so I wasn't going to put in the effort. The senior product person said, in effect,

> "Douglas, get over yourself. You're in product. Make the business successful - that's what matters."

That stuck with me. It's a compass for product people of all roles and responsibilities. Of course, everyone in the company should think like that. But *"product people"*, whose KPIs and problem/solution space can be all over the place, will have to start from the fundementals more often.

## What does a product engineer look like?

"Product-oriented" people aren't *better*, but they are *different* in their motivations, skills, and experiences. Product-oriented people prioritize individually contributing towards business impact at the cost of working on less "interesting" problems. Deeply technical, product-oriented people are like deeply technical managers - rare, because they're divergent paths.

**When I look at an engineer's resume**, I look for prioritizing impact over working on interesting tech. Prioritizing impact looks a lot like prioritizing status. Today's status was yesterday's impact? Or maybe impact feels like the road to status?

Here are some indicators of prioritizing impact over interesting tech that show up on resumes:

* Founder or worked at an early-stage startup
* Lead of a team and talks about users or customers
* Forward-deployed engineer or engineer in consulting company
* UX experience or interest

**When I interview engineers**, I look for decisions where they decided between impact and interesting tech. I also use this question to evaluate how "product-oriented" they are:

> How do you prefer to get specifications for features or things you have to build? *There's no right answer - it's a spectrum.*
> 
> For example:
>
> 1. Do you prefer to get user stories from a PM so you can focus on architecting and building the solution?
> 2. Do you prefer to get high-level requirements from a sales-person so that you can work with them to turn it into specs?
> 3. Do you prefer to get raw feedback from end-users so you can figure out what feature to build?
>
> Where do you fall on that spectrum? Can you give an example?

A "good" answer is when the person says they're on the part of the spectrum that the team needs.

An "experienced" answer sounds something like, "I've done all of them. I'm best at #3, prefer #2, and avoid #1."

<summary><b>Story #1</b>: My mistaken investment</summary>

<br/>

Healthcare systems in a foreign country? Doctors, nurses, hospitals, gp practices, rota management... I worked in this company, but I had no interest in this domain.

<br/><br/>

I wanted to improve transferrable skills. I expected product managers and designers to hand me specs, so I could focus on architecting and building. That mostly worked out, but when our team met the cofounders for strategic discussions, I couldn't contribute. I could estimate the effort involved in building a mockup, but I couldn't propose an alternative with 2x value at 0.5x cost.

<br/><br/>

Others could smell my lack of enthusiasm for the business - especially the cofounders, who lived and breathed it. Cofounders, managers, and teammates all want you to be invested in the company and team. When you prove your investment in the business, others will reciprocate with more investment in you. I could have accelerated my growth in responsibilities and position if I displayed more enthusiasm for the product and business.

<br/><br/>

Five years later, here I am working in that same product domain and a different technical one.

<summary><b>Story #2</b>: Product engineers without product context</summary>

<br/>

I once joined a team that needed its engineers to behave like product engineers. They didn't.

<br/><br/>

The developers only met with their users when directed to, even though their users worked at desks a few meters away. The developer team waited for decisions to come from product managers and designers. The service they worked on was just a piece of a much larger product, about which they had little context. Decisions <i>happened to them</i> and they weren't in control of their future. Their projects went off-track and got cancelled. They often built the wrong thing, and how could they know what the right thing was? They barely grasped what was needed of <i>their</i> small piece of a much larger puzzle.

<br/><br/>

Of course, these circumstances came from mismanagement, blitz-scaling, and recent bad experiences - not the developers themselves, who were mostly new anyways.

<br/><br/>

The PM expressed that the developers were always invited to interact with users, but didn't really participate. During onboarding, I did some user interviews to build context. Afterwards, I seeded FOMO by sharing how I interviewed our users, gaining key information and relationships necessary to make the best technical decisions.

<br/><br/>

One month in, my first project on the team was set to begin bridging two products. Over and over, the team resisted a solution because we had a fear of imagined risks. We ended up going down the "low-risk" path that incurred tech debt - we spent six developer-months on a project and didn't finish. The solution was scrapped and we redid it properly later when everyone had sufficient context.
