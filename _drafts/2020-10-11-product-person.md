In a previous job I was onboarding a senior product person. I complained that some important task wasn't one of my responsibilities so I wasn't going to put in the effort. The senior product person said (in effect),

"Douglas, get over yourself. You're in product. What matters is making the business successful."

And that stuck with me. Now I cultivate that, "do what the business needs" attitude in product people of all roles and responsibilities.

### What's the value?

***turn this into a Lantum story - rota admin? I don't know/care about doctors in this foreign country.

Others can smell your enthusiasm. Especially founders.

In my earlier jobs, I didn't care about the business or the product. I wanted to work on skills that were transferrable, and to me, product/business knowledge clearly wasn't transferrable.


### How can you tell?

When I interview engineers, this is the question I use to evaluate how "product-oriented" they are:

> How do you prefer to get specifications for features or things you have to build? **There's no right answer - it's a spectrum.**
> 
> For example:
> * Do you prefer to get user stories from a PM so you can focus on architecting and building the solution?
> * Do you prefer to get high-level requirements from a business person so that you can work with them to turn it into specs?
> * Do you prefer to get raw feedback from end-users that you turn into requirements?
>
> Where do you fall on that spectrum? Can you give an example?

### Caveats

Career considerations are important - one of the things that makes a business successful is it's employees continuing to want to work there.

Product teams with good attitudes are still ruined by mismanagement - ex: putting four engineers and a PM on a project with heavy UX and project management needs will burn out the PM and bore the engineers.

More "product-oriented" isn't better or worse, and highly technical people who are also product-oriented are hard to find. I would be wary of a very product-oriented person solo re-architecting a data pipeline - they might get bored and frustrated.
