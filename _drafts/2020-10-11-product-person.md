In a previous job I was onboarding a senior product person. I complained that some important task wasn't one of my responsibilities so I wasn't going to put in the effort. The senior product person said (in effect),

"Douglas, get over yourself. You're in product. What matters is making the business successful."

And that stuck with me. Now I cultivate that, "do what the business needs" compass in product people of all roles and responsibilities.


Business-orientied --> product-oriented + technical-oriented. Easy to lean hard either way, try to toe the line.
Learn to be tech lead + product manager + architect.

### What's the value?

### Too far technical-oriented

#### Sub-optimal investment

Healthcare systems in a foreign country? Doctors, nurses, hospitals, gp practices, rota management... I had no interest in this domain. The marketplace aspect was interesting. I expected product managers and designers to hand me specs, so I could focus on architecting and building. That social contract mostly worked, but when our team met the cofounders for strategic discussions, I couldn't contribute. All I could do was estimate the effort involved in building a mockup. And others could smell my lack of enthusiasm for the business - especially cofounders, who live and breathe it. Cofounders, bosses, etc all want you to be invested in the company, and when you prove that, they will invest more in you. I could have accellerated my advancement if I displayed more. 

Five years later, here I am working in that same product domain with a different tech stack - healthcare systems, doctors, etc. AI instead of marketplace.

#### No power

I once joined a team that needed engineers to behave like product engineers, but didn't.

The developers only met with their users when directed to, even though their users worked at desks a few meters away. The developer team waited for decisions to come from product managers and designers. The product they worked on was just a piece of a much larger product, about which they had little context. Decisions *happened to them* and they weren't in control of their future. Off-track projects were cancelled. They often built the wrong thing, and how could they know what the right thing was? They barely grasped what was needed of _their_ small piece of a much larger puzzle. What they built was inevitably going to be 

I had to correct this. The PM expressed that the developers were always invited, but didn't really participate. Like my usual self-directed onboarding, I did some user interviews to build context. Afterwards, I shared how I interviewed our users, and that the developers were missing out on key information. They felt FOMO.

One month in, my first project on the team was to begin bridging two products. The team over and over resisted a solution, because they had a fear of risks. We ended up going the "low-risk" path. We spent six man-months on a project. The solution was scrapped and we did it properly later when everyone had sufficient context.

### Too far product-oriented

Tractable?

### How can you tell?

When I interview engineers, this is the question I use to evaluate how "product-oriented" they are:

> How do you prefer to get specifications for features or things you have to build? **There's no right answer - it's a spectrum.**
> 
> For example:
> * Do you prefer to get user stories from a PM so you can focus on architecting and building the solution?
> * Do you prefer to get high-level requirements from a sales-person so that you can work with them to turn it into specs?
> * Do you prefer to get raw feedback from end-users so you can figure out what feature to build?
>
> Where do you fall on that spectrum? Can you give an example?

### Caveats

Career considerations are important - one of the things that makes a business successful is it's employees continuing to want to work there.

Product teams with good attitudes are still ruined by mismanagement - ex: putting four engineers and a PM on a project with heavy UX and project management needs will burn out the PM and bore the engineers.

More "product-oriented" isn't better or worse, and highly technical people who are also product-oriented are hard to find. I would be wary of a very product-oriented person solo rebuilding a data pipeline - they might get bored and frustrated.
