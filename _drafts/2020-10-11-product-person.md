In a previous job I was onboarding a senior product person. I complained that some important task wasn't one of my responsibilities so I wasn't going to put in the effort. The senior product person said (in effect),

"Douglas, get over yourself. You're in product. What matters is making the business successful."

And that stuck with me. "Do what the business needs" is a great compass for product people of all roles and responsibilities. Of course, everyone in the company should think like that. But product people, whose metrics and problem/solution space can be all over the place, will have to refer back to the fundementals more often.

#### Sub-optimal investment

Healthcare systems in a foreign country? Doctors, nurses, hospitals, gp practices, rota management... I worked in this company, but I had no interest in this domain.

I wanted to improve transferrable skills. I expected product managers and designers to hand me specs, so I could focus on architecting and building. That mostly worked out, but when our team met the cofounders for strategic discussions, I couldn't contribute. I could estimate the effort involved in building a mockup, but I couldn't propose an alternative with 2x value and 0.5x cost.

And others could smell my lack of enthusiasm for the business - especially the cofounders, who lived and breathed it. Cofounders, managers, teammates - they all want you to be invested in the company and team. When you prove your devotion, they will invest more in you. I could have accelerated my growth in responsibilities and position if I displayed more enthusiasm for the product and business.

Five years later, here I am working in that same product domain and a different technical one.

#### Weak without product context

I once joined a team that needed its engineers to behave like product engineers. They didn't.

The developers only met with their users when directed to, even though their users worked at desks a few meters away. The developer team waited for decisions to come from product managers and designers. The product they worked on was just a piece of a much larger product, about which they had little context. Decisions *happened to them* and they weren't in control of their future. Off-track projects were cancelled, they often built the wrong thing. And how could they know what the right thing was? They barely grasped what was needed of _their_ small piece of a much larger puzzle.

The PM expressed that the developers were always invited to interact with users, but didn't really participate. During onboarding, I did some user interviews to build context. Afterwards, I shared how I interviewed our users, and that the developers were missing out on key information and relationships. They felt FOMO.

One month in, my first project on the team was to begin bridging two products. Over and over, the team resisted a solution because we had a fear of imagined risks. We ended up going down the "low-risk" path that incurred tech debt - we spent six man-months on a project and didn't finish. The solution was scrapped and we redid it properly later when everyone had sufficient context.

### What does a product engineer sound like?

"Product-oriented" people aren't *better*, but they are *different* - in their motivations, skills, and experiences. For example, I would be wary of a product-oriented person solo rebuilding a data pipeline to eliminate tech debt because they might get bored and frustrated. Deeply technical people who are also product-oriented are rare, because those are divergent paths.

When I interview engineers, this is what I ask to evaluate how "product-oriented" they are:

> How do you prefer to get specifications for features or things you have to build? *There's no right answer - it's a spectrum.*
> 
> For example:
> * Do you prefer to get user stories from a PM so you can focus on architecting and building the solution?
> * Do you prefer to get high-level requirements from a sales-person so that you can work with them to turn it into specs?
> * Do you prefer to get raw feedback from end-users so you can figure out what feature to build?
>
> Where do you fall on that spectrum? Can you give an example?

A "good" answer is when the person says they're on the part of the spectrum that I'm hiring for.

An "experienced" answer is, "I've done all of them. I'm best at X, prefer Y, and try to avoid Z."
