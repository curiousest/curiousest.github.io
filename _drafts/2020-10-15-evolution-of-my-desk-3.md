Pandemic struck and overnight we started working from home. The beginning was painful. I had a deep, sinking relationship with my couch.

I thought, "it can't last more than another month or so". A few months rolled by. Management at my workplace shared the results of an employee survey: an overwhelming majority of the 1000-3000 person tech company wanted to work from home for most of the week, forevermore. I accepted the new reality - remote work is here to stay. I needed a wfh setup.

## Desk setup

[I figured out my preferences years ago](/2017/06/13/evolution-of-my-desk.html). I started in my living room on the floor, building up and tearing down the setup every week. (lasted ~2-3 months)
[pic]

I wanted alternative orientations and less setup/teardown effort. I set up this. (lasted ~4-6 months)
[kneeling]
[standing]
[lying]

I was easily distracted and interrupted in the living room. It was also too messy. I set up in my bedroom hallway floor because I didn't have a desk. (lasted ~4-6months)
[kneeling]

It was in an awkward position and being in one position all the time was tiring. I set up a standing/kneeling desk with an [ikea shelf](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/fjaellbo-shelving-unit-black-70342199/).

* I don't stay in one bad posture for a long time (no sitting on a chair).
* One position is comfortable enough to write code for up to one hour
* Low setup to change positions
* Don't make home messy

## Video

The [Logitech H1250](amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006A2Q81M) seemed to be the webcam to get. The price went from 45 to 90 in the pandemic and never came back down.

Any light is much better than no light. Ring lights are a good first step because they're the hardest to do "wrong" with unflattering shadows. Shadows are inconsistent light intensity - they happen on your face at a desk when light sources come from the sides with varying intensities. They also give your eyes an aesthetically-pleasing, gleaming ring reflection. After one light, you can explore three-point lighting and more. The world of streaming, portrait photography, and lighting is vast.

There's high overlap between lighting pictures and video. The main differences between them is the moving subject, the ability to choose which images are used, the differing shutter speed, and the ability to use flash. [More](https://www.techsmith.com/blog/get-perfect-lighting-video/) [here](https://www.borrowlenses.com/blog/portrait-lighting/).

I got a [ring light](amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08423RKGL) and a back light. I use the ring light all the time because it makes a big difference. I rarely use the back light, because it's more setup and only adds a cool contrast outline effect.

These are screenshots of zoom video with under different lighting conditions.

Is what you see in zoom similar to what others see? Check screenshots on iPad in zoom meeting to check that they're the same quality (so that it looks like how others would see)

## Audio

I'm proud of my beautiful voice and I want it heard. I got a [Blue Yeti microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00N1YPXW2). 

The first time I used it with colleagues, they died laughing that I sounded like a late-night radio broadcaster.

"this is my voice on the built-in 2020 macbook laptop microphone two feet from my face"
"this is my voice through Bose 35 headphones"
"and this, this is my voice on a blue yeti microphone three inches from my face. mmmm much better"

I haven't solved the sound reflecting off hard surfaces around me. That's a guaranteed rabbit hole.
