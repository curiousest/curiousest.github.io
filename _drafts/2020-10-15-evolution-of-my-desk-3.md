Pandemic struck and overnight we started working from home five-days-a-week.


The beginning was painful - you get into a love-hate relationship with your couch. I thought, "it can't last more than another month or so". A few more months rolled by, and I built makeshift monitor towers out of shoe boxes and hardcover books. I assembled my desk every Monday and tore it down every Friday.

Five months in, management at my workplace shared the results of an employee survey. The vast majority of a ~2000-person tech company wanted to work from home three or more days per week.

I accepted the new reality - remote work is here to stay.

That meant I needed a WFH workspace.

## Videoconferencing
### Sound and Microphone

I have a beautiful voice, so I wanted to make sure it is heard.

The first time I used it with colleagues, they died laughing that I sounded like a late-night radio broadcaster.

I haven't solved the sound reflecting off hard surfaces around me.

I got an adapter that let me use the microphone with my devices

"this is my voice on an iphone 6S+ mic"
"this is my voice on an 2017 ipad pro mic"
"this is my voice on a 2019 dell laptop mic"
"and THIS is my voice on a blue yeti mic"

### Videocamera and Lighting

Any light is much better than no light. Apparently circle lights make your face look better because there are no shadows. They also give your eyes a funny ring reflection.

### Software mastery and the art of meetings

# BAU
## The basics
I started with the basics (for me):

* Standing / kneeling alternatives

monitor mount with keyboard shelf

## What room?

bookshelf

state-dependent memory, so not bedroom desk.
