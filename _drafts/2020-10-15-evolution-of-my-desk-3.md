(three orientations - standing, lying, kneeling)

Pandemic struck and overnight we started working from home five-days-a-week.

(picture slouching/sleeping on couch)

The beginning was painful. I got into a love-hate relationship with my couch. I thought, "it can't last more than another month or so". A few more months rolled by, and I built makeshift monitor towers out of shoe boxes and hardcover books. I assembled my desk every Monday and tore it down every Friday.

Five months in, management at my workplace shared the results of an employee survey. An overwhelming majority of my ~2000-person tech company wanted to work from home 3+ days per week.

I accepted the new reality: remote work is here to stay. I needed a WFH setup.

## Video: Camera and Lighting

ring light

Any light is much better than no light. Apparently circle lights make your face look better because there are no shadows. They also give your eyes an aesthetically pleasing ring reflection.

100ms video instead of picture. Bobbling head / moving eyes. Capture as zoom mini viewer box?

It used to be 45, now it's 90...

## Audio: Microphone and Soundscape

I have a beautiful voice, so I wanted to make sure it is heard.

The first time I used it with colleagues, they died laughing that I sounded like a late-night radio broadcaster.

I haven't solved the sound reflecting off hard surfaces around me.

I got an adapter that let me use the microphone with my devices

"this is my voice on an iphone 6S+ mic"
"this is my voice on an 2017 ipad pro mic"
"this is my voice on a 2019 dell laptop mic"
"and THIS is my voice on a blue yeti mic"

## Desk setup

The key considerations for any of my desk setups are:

* Standing / kneeling alternatives
* Good posture enforced
* One position is comfortable enough to program for up to one hour

Work from home introduced new considerations:

* State-dependent memory, so not bedroom desk.
* 

I have no separate room with windows in my flat, so 
monitor mount with keyboard shelf

## What room?

bookshelf
