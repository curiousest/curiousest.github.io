Tuesday 11:04am my phone rings. My phone doesn't normally ring and I like it that way. But it's ringing now.

>"...uhh-hhello?"

>"Hi, is this Douglas speaking?"

>"Yup."

>"This is James from the Register. I see you're a Staff Engineer at Babylon. We're having a Datadog conference in November 21st. We'll be talking logging and observability. Would you... be interested?"

He has my phone number, job title, and company. How?

>"Ok."

>"..."

>"Brill, can I send the invite to your work email?"

>"Ok. Yeah."

>"It's Douglas dot... Hindson. at BabylonHealth dot com, yeh?"

>"mhm"

Work email and phone number. Only my company has those. They must've leaked. A logging or analytics service? No, they wouldn't need my phone number for signup. It had to be an HR service or HR data sharing.

>"Ok Douglas, I'll send that over now!"

>"James, if I may ask, 'cuz. I'm... How did you get my number?"

>"ehhh - it's on the list, yeah? This sheet- We get it from the system, ya know?"

>"Ok."

>"..."

>"Well Douglas, I'll send you over that conference invitation."

>"Yeah, have a good day!"

>"Cheeeers Douglas. Cheers."

So I followed up with an email, and they pointed me to a [personal data aggregator](https://www.leadiro.com/), who pointed me to [another personal data aggregator](https://www.peopledatalabs.com/see-my-data-form), who explained what companies were distributing my personal data.

I asked the aggregators to delete my personal data and I filed complaints about PeopleDataLabs and LinkedIn for their bad behaviour.

I believe in sharing information. I think sharing information is making the world better.

The act of sharing information is cheap - usually just a button click. But there's a risk that the information you share will cost you in the future - time, personal attacks, future opportunities, embarrassment... And the benefits of sharing personal information are slim - usually convenience of accessing services, social proof, and healthy vanity. I want the world to get better, and I want people to share more useful information, so I want personal risks from sharing information to be lower and I want the rewards to be higher.

Ex 1: demographics of a startup over time, so that startups get better practices

Ex 2: census

Ex 3: 

My career history has a low risk of costing me in the future and it can be really useful information in aggregate! I'm happy for it to be public. Society is not going to get better by sharing around my phone number or email. Anything about some company or stranger using my phone number or email is going to cost me time and annoyance, and at best they intrusively advertise something that I'm interested in (this has never happened). At worst I get robo-calls and spam every day until I change contact details or it's spoofed/phised to execute a social engineering attack (this happens regularly).

I was let down, so I want to share less information. When our trust is betrayed, we overcompensate. It's a delicate balance - especially when the stakes are high, like with health and financial data.

<summary>Strawman: "That's easy to say when you have a good career history." (click to expand)</summary>
We're reliant on career history because it's the only data we have to make decisions with. If we had data that diverse histories are more valuable, then we would make different decisions. We're limited by the data we have. If we found (contrary to popular opinion) that diverse histories do not benefit individual teams or companies, but society at large does benefit, then we'd have data to encourage regulation.

The thing is, some people **want** to share their contact details and some people **don't want** to share their career history. People have different preferences, and that makes all of this fuzzy and complicated. 

## Appendix

Each email conversations looked something like this:

(Screenshot email chain?) pls give me personal info
...
One month later...
one month elapsed. in one week I'm going to report you
the next day...
Hi, sorry we took so long. Here's your personal information.
Where did you get this from?
We got it from here.


### Data


[Here's the data](https://github.com/curiousest/curiousest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/resources/people_data_labs.json) that the main aggregator, <a href="https://www.peopledatalabs.com/see-my-data-form">People Data Labs</a>, had on me.

It's a combination of my career history from LinkedIn, usernames on social networking websites, and contact details (redacted for this post):
