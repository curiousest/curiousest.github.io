**ðŸ”” Ding! ðŸ”” Ding! ðŸ”” Ding!**

It's 5am. A bell rings inches from the frozen window. I unstick my dry tongue from it's perch on the roof of my mouth. The room is filled with seven other men in bunk beds. We're tired and silent. We line up to leave the room, one of five along the hall. We line up for the urinals. We line up to leave the building, no wind or rustling leaves. We line up to enter the lecture room. We line up in a grid, sitting, waiting for waiting's sake.

We're in meditation camp.

#### Once upon a time,

Six years ago, I meditated for 10-days in a Bangalore Vippassana camp and learned so, so much:

That practicing equanimity in the face of cravings and aversions is a useful kind of meditation.

Where equanimity is accepting what I am experiencing - not reacting.

And cravings are things that I want to feel, while aversions are things that I don't want to feel.

#### I arrived at a mental model.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NKonC8c.png"><br/>

I have a tank of willpower. I use up willpower to resist cravings or aversions, doing the things that wouldn't be my easy default choice. When I'm low on willpower, I'm more likely to make impulsive decisions that satisfy my instinctive immediate desires. I'm less likely to make the best short-term decisions for my long-term goals. Meditation increases the capacity of my willpower tank by training those "mental muscles".

#### But the mental model was flawed.

In that mental model, it's willpower and not meditation that helps make better decisions. But the stereotype of someone who meditates is calm wisdom. Everyone who is well-rested does not exhibit calm wisdom. How is a willpower tank any different from overall energy and how tired I am? Something doesn't add up.

Six years after my first meditation camp, I went to a four-day meditation camp in Suffolk, England.

No food after noon. I've been trying to gain muscle mass lately, but we're having two small vegetarian meals each day, less than 2000 calories. 3400 calories is what I need to maintain what I have. I must take my mind off hunger, so I walk.

There's a large grassy area where the men walk in circles, clockwise. The grass bends forwards. A loop takes five to ten minutes at a contemplative pace, and my thoughts are running a-monk.

I feel like the willpower tank analogy is flawed. Meditation helps me make better decisions, even in times of low willpower. If meditation just makes the willpower tank bigger, it wouldn't help times of low willpower. So what is it doing?

It's a practice. What skill am I practicing? What do I *do* when I meditate? I sit still, concentrate on sensory experiences, but my mind wanders. I catch it, accept the small failure, reflect on the failure, then ease back into concentration.

It's like I practice being a fly on the wall to my own consciousness. I practice accepting what I uncontrollably think and feel - not indulging. My mind exhibits unexpected behaviours and I notice them. I analyze where they came from, then I use all this information to choose what action to take.

I am practicing being an objective observer of myself. That feels like the right direction to explore. How are objective observer useful?

What if I am like a complex distributed system? Complex distributed systems have properties that are hard to deal with, often exhibiting emergent behaviours that are difficult to diagnose. Small things combine and cascade in unexpected ways - like someone breaking unexpectedly on a highway [causing a traffic jam several kilometers behind](https://youtu.be/7wm-pZp_mi0?t=32). If I really want to change those emergent behaviours, the first step is to understand them - by observing them and identifying underlying causes. Then I can adjust the root causes of those behaviours instead of the surface-level symptoms.

#### I came to a new mental model

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XeAfuYf.png"><br/>

Meditation is a practice that sharpens the tools I use to debug myself. The behaviours I exhibit have complex underlying causes. In meditation, I practice observing unexpected behaviours in myself, so that I can identify what causes them. With root causes, I have greater ability to change the behaviours as I see fit.

Moreover, other people are complex distributed systems. The observational powers I'm building up must translate to observing others - identifying the root causes of the behaviours they exhibit. The stereotypical monk is wise, empathetic, and controlled. The epitome of emotional intelligence. I believe that comes from their ability to observe people and identify the underlying causes of their behaviour. All the while, controlling their own reactions by that same mechanism.
