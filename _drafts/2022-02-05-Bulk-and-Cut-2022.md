I intentionally gained muscle and fat, then lost it over the course of Nov 2021 -> April 2022 -> July 2022.

## Before the bulk

I had done three bulk and cut cycles in my life before. My last major cut ended in July 2021, and I had been maintaining my weight and bodyfat % since then. I had been doing CrossFit for one year, doing classes 5x/week for the past six months.

## The bulk

Overview

* 6wks caloric surplus, then 2wks caloric deficit at 10% of maintenance.
* Monitor bodyweight and strength gains to make diet decisions. If I'm not gaining after 1-2wks, eat 300kcal/day more.
* CrossFit is the main stimulus. Select classes for strength-oriented workouts, try to burn less calories in general.
* Follow the intent of the workouts, but optimize for strength gain where possible (add weight). <expandable examples from notes>
* Occassionally do bodybuilding workouts outside of classes <expandable examples, muscle groups usually ignored by CrossFit - chest, mid-back, arms, can always do more core>

<expandable: Click to see side-story: placement in CrossFit Open.>
* I did pretty ok in the CrossFit open - ~36000/144000 or ~25th percentile <first MU is workout! MU video>

<expandable: Click to see side-story: Battle for Middle Ground, CrossFit competition>
* I did a team competition <picture of four, picture of two, dying pic, OHP pic>
* I ate like 5500kcal/day, it was crazy

### Nutrition

<kcal graph>

Every time I've bulked, when I reached my peak caloric intake I felt:
* less productive 
* more sluggish
* a lower mood
* looking forward to losing weight

This is what my eating habits looked like for the majority of days @4500kcal/day:

6:20

7:00

- 1-2L water (winter vs. summer)

8:30 1500kcal

"outliers"

## The cut

Cuts feel more obsessive. Incur body image issues kinda thing.
Best way to stop feeling hungry at night is to sleep.
More alive, meditative, focused.
Prefer the average feeling of cutting than bulking, but the worst of cutting feels worse than bulking.
