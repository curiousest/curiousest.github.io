I went from 78kg, ~6-9% bodyfat to 9Xkg, ~15% bodyfat to 8Xkg, ~6-9% bodyfat over the course of Nov 2021 -> April 2022 -> July 2022.

## Before the bulk

I had done three bulk and cut cycles in my life before. My last major cut ended in July 2021, and I had been maintaining my weight and bodyfat % since then. I had been doing CrossFit for one year, doing classes 5x/week for the past six months.

At 78-80kg bodyweight test numbers were roughly:

1RM deadlift: 150kg
1RM back squat: 90kg
1RM shoulder press: 60kg
20min row pace: ~1:50 or ~5475m

## The bulk

Structure (use calendar picture)

* 6wks caloric surplus, 2wks minor 10% of maintenance caloric deficit.
* Monitor bodyweight and strength gains to make diet decisions. If I'm not gaining, eat 300kcal/day more.
* CrossFit is the main stimulus. Select for strength workout classes, try to burn less calories in general
* Follow the intent of the workouts, but optimize for strength gain where possible (add weight). <expandable examples from notes>
* Occassionally do bodybuilding workouts outside of classes <expandable examples, muscle groups usually ignored by CrossFit - chest, mid-back, arms, can always do more core>
