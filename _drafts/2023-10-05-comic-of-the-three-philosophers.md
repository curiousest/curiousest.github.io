There once was a set of chairs. And on these set of chairs sat three philosophers. They were playing a game - who can get closest to the truth? Who can say the least while still saying something.

The first philosopher posed the idea of "closure". Where meaning explodes out of a rhetorical set of assumptions in a bounded context.

The second philosopher said,
"That’s not skeptical enough."
The second philosopher proceeded to pose an implosion of meaning, where a skeptical rationalist approach takes everything else apart before collapsing in on itself.

"I don’t think you’ve said anything with that. What do you think?"
said the first philosopher, nudging the third philosopher to contribute.

The third philosopher didn't answer.

"Oh I see, our very unspoken existence is the least something possible. Clever."
said the first philosopher.

"I'm skeptical of that. Is that really what you meant?"
asked the second philosopher to the third philosopher.

The first philosopher nudged the third philosopher again. The third philosopher slumped over, dead.

"Unspoken non-existence... well we can't beat that."
said the second philosopher.
