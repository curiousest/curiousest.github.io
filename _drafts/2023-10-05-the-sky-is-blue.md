I believe in God,
Like I believe the sky is blue.
It’s blue now, right?
Maybe a little grey.
And sometimes it turns red, orange, purple, or black.
Is that Satan?
No, I just have to open my mind to different shades of blue.
And when we look down from space, what about the sky then?
It’s a question for you,
I’m set.
I believe in God,
Like I believe the sky is blue.
