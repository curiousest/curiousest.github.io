There's hard skills, there's soft skills, and there's *something else*...

The way I see it, hard skills are the "not-interpersonal skills". Soft skills are everything else [1]. There's *something else* in the "everything else" bucket, and it's borderline offensive.

++ team: fiefdoms
minus individual: burnout
minus org: politics. org positioned to fail
minus team: day-to-day conflict
