Inspiration:
- https://elzurdo.github.io/autobiography/

Pronouns are for when don't know who you're talking about.

[not talking about people/groups of people?]

[another one, from the perspective of the people or categories/groups of people that were important or shaped me. "Who I'm made of". Tabular view because it's made of notable interactions over time. Include relationship with cities, companies, schools, hobbies? LLM composes story from prompt using db, like "what was Douglas up to in Oct 2022?"]

St. Isidore.
Catholic School. Below-average student. Bit of a crybaby. Mediocre athlete.

Stonecrest
Switched to another school. Suddenly among top of the class, top athlete, popular-enough. Not sure why.
Competitive soccer and basketball.
Tried the flute, didn't click.
Wrote some bomb poetry, didn't think to continue.

West Carleton
Competitive sports, in order of investment:
1. Soccer (least physically-compatible)
2. Badminton
3. Basketball
4. Nordic skiing
5. Volleyball
6. Cross-country running
7. Squash

Learned how to methodically revise in grade nine geography exams. Had no interest in most of the topics. Revision felt good, though.

Got into math and computer science. Picked the Canadian computer science university program with the highest entry requirements, no other criteria.

Waterloo Software Engineering

Top quartile in first year. Realized grades weren't an appropriate optimization objective. Never looked at EOY grades again.

Failed a course, "Professional Development for Engineers", but so did a lot of other people. "Fuck PD-Eng" was a popular meme. Learning moment. Internalized the consequences of arbitrary bureaucracy.

Years 2-5 were "four months of classes -> four months of work" continuously. Worked in Ottawa (CA), Toronto (CA), Kitchener (CA), Redmond (USA), and Beijing (CN). Internalized constant change.

Culture shock in China. Extreme ups and downs. Had to keep too many friends and family updated, started this blog and a youtube channel.

Bought into entrepreneurship hype. Went to youth entrepreneurship conferences. Lived in a startup accelerator residence in its opening semester and after. Tried to start a company in last work term and while graduating. Didn't work out.

Dublin

Bad job market. "Worked" in a tech consulting company, on the bench for nine months before quitting.

South-East Asia
