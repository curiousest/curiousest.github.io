## Purpose

Competitive fitness game, which auto-scales to relative fitness level of competitors.
[Fitness should be autoscaling for more precision in a different area. Like connect-4 or gymnastics. First few moves should be just a little important, then moves get progressively more critical as time goes on.]
[random number with a multiplier that increases every round, along with autoscaling]
[force relearning how hard you have to try, every game]
[don't make it feel like initial scaling choice determines everything. randomness, novel movements, new people and their relative strengths]
[simulating long cardio buildup, then exciting sprints at the end when everyone is dead tired, pushing their limits, having to strategize and mindgame while exhausted]

[app that does the scoring for you. all you do at the beginning is enter initial conditions, then press start, then say who won each round and another button for a "super win" or w/e]
[rules of *this* game made up as you go. rules of the set of games could have overlap too]
[give the ref/coach a dial of how much to tip the scales in different directions. current state of the game reflects what has happened so far, coach sets dial to make it more even]
[players don't know when its going to end, just see likelihood of winning]

## What you need
- A cardio machine
	- ex: echo bike, rowing machine, ski erg
- A movement, or group of movements, where you can do 40-50 reps in roughly the amount of time it would take you to do 40-50kcal on the cardio machine
	- ex: burpees, pull-ups/C2B/MU, barbell cleans/snatches/C&J
- An opponent

## The objective of the game

- Each player starts with a number of "health points" and a number of "attack points".
- Each round, the loser of the round will lose either "health" or "attack" points.
- To win, get your opponent's "health points" down to "0" OR get your own "attack points" down to "0".

## What happens in a round

### Part 1: Setup

- One player is on a cardio machine, on "defense".
	- This round, they have to do calories equal to their "health points"
- The other player is set up for their non-machine movement, on "attack".
	- This round, they have to do reps equal to their "attack points"

### Part 2: Workout

- Both players race to finish their calories or reps.
- The first player to finish their calories or reps first wins the round.

### Part 3: Scoring

- The loser of the round loses points on whatever movement they were doing.
	- ex: if player 1 lost while on the cardio machine, then player 1 loses "health points"
	- ex: if player 2 lost while doing burpees, then player 2 loses "attack points"
- The loser of the round loses 20% (1/5) of their starting points.
	- ex: if player 1 lost on the cardio machine, and started with 50 points, and had 40 points, then they now have 30 points.
- If the loser of the round finished less than half of their required calories/reps, then the winner also reduces their "attack points" by 20% of the starting points.
	- ex: if player 1 finished the cardio machine, and player 2 had only finished 20 out of 50 reps, then player 2 loses 20% of their "attack points" and player 1 loses 20% of their "attack points"

### Part 4: transition

- 20 seconds between rounds, shared countdown.
- Each player updates their points.
- Each player confirms their target calories/reps.

## Considerations

Choose starting calories and reps for each person where they would take around the same amount of time to do the opposite movements.
