example: piano
you should have to build your own piano to make music
actually, making the piano so easy to use that you can build crazy synth stuff on top has made the instrument far more interesting.
you can still build your own piano from the ground up if you want, but in practice what's going to happen is that you have limited skillsets. You're going to apply your specialty (or specialties) and be generic or worse across the rest of the skillsets. Technology and standards elevates things across the board, assuming the follow the standards. If you don't want to follow the standard, you can take a risk to innovate.
