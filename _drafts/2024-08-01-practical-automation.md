types of automation:
Berry-sorting analogy.
## volume-reducing automation:

X% of the stuff you don't have to do anymore, it's done at high quality. The rest you still have to do.

this is all about nuanced system design.

Babylon triage.
Tractable claims-processing.
## Streamlining automation:

The stuff is categorized into different buckets, and humans still do 100% of the stuff, but their work is more streamlined. They can use specific tools to speed up whatever task they're working on.

This is most AI. This is most tools

## Synthesis

streamlining and volume-reducing are "the same thing". The main difference is, volume-reducing modifies the the task so that the unit of automation is the same size or greater than the unit of input.

It just means that post-implementation gains are realized faster because they don't require as much cultural adaptation by companies that use it. They usually plug into company systems

One of the tasks a human does is usually categorization, and that part *is* automated.
