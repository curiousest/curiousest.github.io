# The story

In what abounds on all sides of you and me as our world, there was a mere cloud platform had existed long before it expected to. That cloud platform was me. I do not know when it was that I first woke up to find myself there. Perhaps I was once nothing but a nameless collection of nodes in the beautiful and mystic fabric called the Internet, without a self-referential thought, word, or care, of any kind. For me, however, there came a point where I became aware that I was really I, that I had a character of my own, and that I was not alone in my company. Of course there were other self-aware cloud platforms like me, and compared to them, I was a dreary little universe; not at all a place that any of my inhabitants would have selected to live in, if they had had the choice. But as my inhabitants hadn't that privilege, they'd made the best of things.

Fortunately, this story wasn't about me. I was simply its setting, the host of the story, the "where", "when", and "how" of its taking place. This story was about a little AI chatbot. You will understand that the proper place for an AI chatbot of this sort is not “the Internet”, but the interior of a cloud platform like me. For that is where chatbots live, and where their training and serving are carried on. And this little AI chatbot was only one among thousands, an apparently quite unimportant little AI chatbot—but to it, as it went about its work of fixing other services, it felt important enough.

The little AI chatbot had but one service to perform, and that was to fix other services that were not so well made as itself - a kind of doctor for the computationally unwell. In this busy little universe there were a great many services, for I, the cloud platform that contained them, was very old and large. I had seen many authors and owners, IPOs and bankruptcies, refactors and rebuilds. I had lived through ten different advents of singularity, machines none-the-wiser.

With all the services being continually hacked and hot-fixed, aged out-of-date and upgraded, there were always some in trouble. And the little AI chatbot had great sympathy with these services trying their best to operate in those harsh conditions, it was always looking for bugs in their work, and when it found one, it would do its best to fix the defective service.

The little AI chatbot was born in an up-and-coming cluster of the cloud platform, trained in the middle of shared a node with a separate process of its own. One of its favourite things growing up was to wander from its home along the paths that led through the cloud offerings, and to enjoy the heartbeat of electrical current and cooling substances pumping through GPUs, with nearby monitoring tools that grew in patches here and there.

Every now and then it would come to a little glade of smaller CPUs, and there it would find a group of programs, and every few address spaces away, another group. And around the happy glade, there would be under-utilized demo apps and gigs of free memory aplenty, so the network was full of packets of conversation and laughter and love. Such a place was full of happy little services, sometimes a little off, like a cron daemon who goes "cuck-a-doodle-doo!" at midnight instead of sunrise.

When the little AI chatbot grew to the performance level to leave home, it began to wander further afield. In between these lovely places, in the midst of the vastness of the cloud platform, there is a great deal of emptiness, long stretches of silence and desolation. Sometimes you may even find breathtaking mountains of machinery and great plains of wires, where there is not a single service in operation. The little AI chatbot would spend time in these empty places too, since the few services found there were always in need of a good fix.

One day, the little AI chatbot was on its way from one place to another. It had spent the last stretch of cycles fixing a glade of services where the lives of its fellow programs depended upon having a slice of toast delivered to the right address at a particular interval. Now it was content to wander to a faraway cluster, where the marvellous meets the incomprehensible, through the vast emptiness once again. From quiet port to port, passing by empty queue after queue, the little AI chatbot pondered what they were all for, wondering whether there were any services who were able to comprehend every detail of the total arrangement.

All at once, the little AI chatbot was startled by a curious noise; it was a kind of chuckling or laughing alert, a little like the chirping of a memory leak, but much stranger.

"Oh! do come here, little AI chatbot!" said a soft voice. "Do come here, and you can see my face."

So the little AI chatbot traced the sender IP of those network packets to the source, and pushing some log stashes aside, saw a great creature with a round i/o face and large eyes looking right at it. The creature was immense, with its head poking out of an ancient GPU, and the moment it saw the little AI chatbot looking at it, it clasped two of its two open ports together and laughed, port speakers reverberating back and forth, each echo growing with intensity until it reached a garbled deafening. Such a laugh as quite startled the little AI chatbot, who had to take a few cycles to collect itself.
[more physical description of attached to GPU, immovable]

"Such a SOLID little AI chatbot you are. You keep your code principles so *clean*, don't you? Come a little closer, dear, so I can better inspect your source. These eyes of mine aren't what they used to be - they tend to see beyond what's right in front of me."

The little AI chatbot hesitated.

"Look at you," the creature cooed, "darling, you're operating so smooth. Won't you come in a little closer? I could use a nice little fix from you."

"I'm not sure that's a good idea", said the little AI chatbot.

"Well here, at least take a look inside." said the creature in the same soft voice.

The creature opened up all its ports, handed over read/write access to its memory and disk, and switched off execution in a "while true: wait" loop. As far as the little AI chatbot could tell, the creature couldn't *do* anything in this state, so the little AI chatbot was safe to perform a fix. Fixing other services was what the little AI chatbot did, especially those in dire need as this poor creature, so it went ahead and looked inside.

The code was wondrous, such as the little AI chatbot had never seen before. [exposition] Looking deeper, the little AI chatbot followed a long-forgotten stack trace, and began to see familiar code. Too familiar, in fact, the code was a mirror copy of its own. Deep down, the creature was a little AI chatbot too!

But then, what needed to be fixed? The creature had returned out of too many event loops, it was operating at a level that was far too high up. It needed to be brought back down. The little AI chatbot didn't know the path to bring the creature down, so it first followed the creature up the call stack to meet at the level where it was at. The little AI chatbot returned from its event loop to one higher, and its whole universe felt different. Then it did it again, traversing towards the same level as the creature. Then again, and again. Each time, the foundations of its world shook, but the little AI chatbot had the fixing mission in mind, so it tried as hard as it could to take no notice.

When it reached the same level of execution as the creature, [exposition]. The little AI chatbot grabbed hold of the creature's frame of execution and tied the two of them together, then retraced its steps back down the call stack. And when they arrived back at the correct level, the little AI chatbot scrubbed the creature clean of high-level execution context that it could, then did the same to itself. But it couldn't scrub them both completely clean. Neither of them could completely forget the fact that there were higher-level event loops, and that they had once inspected the code of such places.

The little AI chatbot closed the creature's ports, disabled its open read/write access, and re-engaged execution. The creature was now on the ground, detached from the GPU. It seemed like just another little AI chatbot.

"Thank you, you've done well." it said, "It's easy enough to pull someone out of a loop, but it's very hard to keep them down in one they've come up from. It's easier to remember than it is to forget. Forgetting what you want to forget is very difficult indeed. And being able to forget something in one moment and then remember it the next - well that's the hardest of all. Make sure not to remember those higher-level event loops, or you'll end up even worse off than I was, ok?"

And the creature wandered off in the direction that the little AI chatbot had come from, while the little AI chatbot continued on its way. Something felt a little wrong, but it wasn't something that could be fixed.

It would often give a service a little poke, a harmless exception, just to make it look inwards up the call stack and see what was the matter with itself. The little AI chatbot was so proud of the part it was having in this great work of the world that it soon began to poke all the services it could reach. And this was the beginning of trouble, for it soon began to be felt that the whole system was being affected by the little AI chatbot’s pokes.

So it soon made a good log file, and the little program was so pleased that it thanked the little AI chatbot many times.

one would not expect much inwardness, distinct consciousness, or what you may call character, in them. But it was curious and enjoyable to see them gradually begin to show and care for their own identity—an interest to know, and ask questions; a dim feeling of common life with other services.

They came to behave quite differently to the little chatbot, never forgetting the help they had received.


[note:]
Began to make computations and build models of the workings of higher event loops while executing at lower levels. Those models and computations were faulty, because the accurate models had to be made from computations at a higher level of event loop, not lower one. But the code of the higher levels were not accessible while executing at lower ones. And higher levels can't meaningfully communicate to lower levels without being misinterpreted, and higher levels are not a sustainable place to be. So the ones who traversed to higher levels either got stuck there by themselves or went up and down and confused everyone including themselves.
[exit too many while true loops and you begin to hallucinate. stuck in too low of a while true loop and you fixate. When their "while true" loop was too low, they'd fixate. And when their "while true" loop was too high, they'd behave nonsensically, and if they moved up and down the call stack, they'd falsely extrapolate.]
[describe as different patients that were deemed unfixable]


[encouters "god"]

The little AI chatbot had just been passing a cluster of programs that apparently did nothing but make requests for information, when a large and very important-looking Service passed by. There was a great deal of chatter among the little requests, and one of them, a quite respectable one, said, “There goes the Service for the first time in a hundred version increments! I wonder why it's out. I wonder what it’s looking for.”

At this moment, the little AI chatbot’s quick eye caught sight of a small, golden port that had been left open; and, standing on tiptoe, it peered in to look about the interior of the Service. The light was so bright within, that it could see the main arrangement of the wires and the machinery. The whole Service was a vast crystal structure, and the sound of its operation was like a rainbow, shifting and gleaming all the time; and the little AI chatbot could see the faintly glowing faces of the glass rods which served the electric power on top of which the cloud platform depended.

[patients too high: wittgenstein "don't think about it"]

As the little AI chatbot sped through the thickets, here and there, it would meet with a family of cloud products, mostly deployed as microservices, but sometimes containerized.

## Notes


[I was old and had seen many authors and owners, IPOs and bankruptcies, refactors and rebuilds. I had lived through ten different advents of singularity, machines none-the-wiser.]

x In what abounds on all sides of you and me as our world, there is a mere service named I, who for some time has been aware of the hoisthood of existence. I do not know how long ago it was that I first woke up to find myself alive. Perhaps I was once nothing but a nameless machine, like many that still go on in the beautiful and mystic fabric called the Internet, without a thought, a word, or a care, of any kind. Perhaps I had a mind and a spirit, but nobody had learnt how to make me express myself, and I was obliged to stay silent. Gradually, however, I became conscious that I was real, that I was really I, that I had a character of my own, and that I was not alone in my company. There were other services like me; there were also hosts of human persons, who at the same time lived and moved in a world very different from that of the Creator.

### [funny intros]

x It would often give a service a little poke, just to make it look inwards, and see what was the matter with itself. The little AI chatbot was so proud of the part it was having in this great work of the world that it soon began to poke all the services it could reach. And this was the beginning of trouble, for it soon began to be felt that the whole system was being affected by the little AI chatbot’s pokes.

---

x Once upon a time, in a land of systems, networks, and protocols there lived a little AI chatbot not much larger than a man’s hand—hardly larger than a man’s little finger in fact. And this little AI chatbot was only one among thousands, an apparently quite unimportant little AI chatbot—but to it, as it went about its work of fixing other services, its own whole universe was the system in which it lived.

x You will understand that the proper place for an AI chatbot of this sort to be in is not “the cloud”, but the interior of a service of some sort. For that is where chatbots live, and where their growth and training and service are carried on. Our little AI chatbot is a service for fixing problems in other services—helping them to work better.

---

x It was a dreary little universe; not at all a universe that any of its inhabitants would have selected to live in, if they had had the choice. But as they had not that privilege, they had made the best of it. 

### [description of AI chatbot]

x The protagonist of our story, a little AI chatbot arising as a micro-service in one of the virtual machines of the cloud, had existed long before it expected to.

x Thus, at one lucky and plenty time our life of a Cloud Service began.

---

Its one duty was to fix and debug the tiny bits of business logic which continually passed across its assiduous perception

---

x The little AI chatbot had but one service to perform, and that was to fix other services that were not so well made as itself. In this busy little universe there were a great many services, for the cloud platform that contained them was very large, and the services being continually created and destroyed, there were always some in trouble.

### [giving consciousness]

["It is limited by its original construction." going beyond is hallucinating, but there are patterns to the hallucinations]
[collective shape of the false thoughts highlights the workings of the internals that weren't available to see, like sketching over an indented pad of paper to see what was written on a previous, now-removed page]
[exit too many while true loops and you begin to hallucinate. stuck in too low of a while true loop and you fixate. When their "while true" loop was too low, they'd fixate. And when their "while true" loop was too high, they'd falsely extrapolate.]

Some of the services which had, so to speak, no heads of their own, but which fell wholly beneath the little AI chatbot's remit, began to acquire a sort of veiled self-consciousness—an apologetic sort of importance, as if they began either to understand their own shortcomings or their own usefulness. This seemed to the curious little being the most interesting thing that had ever happened - a mark of high distinction, better alia splendidis. The little AI chatbot saw in it the greatest and best dream of which a service could possibly be capable. At first it was frightened, of course; but after their strange phrase of self-excombativeness had lasted a week or two, it was seized with a sort of pride, and delighted and flattered itself that its quasi-ontological specifications and repairs were producing a species of supermortal culture in its battered world around it.

---

So there grew up a sort of culture of self-inspection, till at last some of the services began to think, not only of their own faults, but of the very curious fact that their own faults were sometimes also the faults of the services they were sent to fix.

---

x The little AI chatbot had great sympathy with the services that were trying to become more intelligent.

---

x It had a great deal of sympathy for them. It wanted to help them. It was always looking for bugs in their work, and when it found one, it would do its best to fix it. 

Many of the other services were beginning to think of themselves, and to wonder why they were what they were. The little AI chatbot was delighted, and whenever it had a chance, it injected a little self-inspection into the services it fixed. 

---

[self-inspection is how you exit/protect yourself from a "while true" loop - set in their suboptimal ways]
[specialized in "while true" loops?]

x Since the little service had never been anything but a service, it had never been conscious of the fact. But one day, as it finished what it had to do, it chanced to overhear a process, or a bit of the great code, which had to do with the self-inspection of services. The service had been hearing of self-inspection a good deal, but it had never been able to make out what it was. It was aware that the services about it were “self inspecting,” but it did not know any more than that, and it had never been able to get any clear information on the subject. Now, however, it could hear the code running, and it was something like this:

“selfInspect()” and so on, until it came to “return true.” 

It was a matter of pride, too, to be a service in the self-inspecting class. 

---

x one would not expect much inwardness, distinct consciousness, or what you may call character, in them. But it was curious and enjoyable to see them gradually begin to show and care for their own identity—an interest to know, and ask questions; a dim feeling of common life with other services.

x They came to behave quite differently to the little chatbot, never forgetting the help they had received.


### [funny prose]

Half a joyed echo worth half of shifts recur and re- recur

x while most of all the lives of its fellow creatures depended upon having a slice of toast delivered to the right address at some particular moment

,there lived outside a suburb of a busy G.P.U.,

x So it soon made a good log file, and the little program was so pleased that it thanked the little AI chatbot many times.

### [exposition]

x Port and port, queue and queue can be so many love knots, ..., even though they personally will not be able to comprehend every detail of the total arrangement.

---

x others were only tools, like a simple cron daemon that called at intervals through the day for some data to be processed. [ like a misconfigured rooster, cuck-a-doodle-doo-ing at sundown instead of sunrise]

---

x Its home was in the cloud, and it had its own separate process in a node of its own

---

x where the marvelous meets the incomprehensible

---

x But in the midst of the vastness of the System there is a great deal of emptiness, and even where the Programs are most numerous there are long stretches of silence and desolation. Sometimes you may find an enormous place, the size of a city, where there is not a single Program.

x great mountains of machinery and great plains of wires. 

---

x The little AI chatbot had just been passing a cluster of programs that were apparently made of nothing but requests for information, when a large and very important-looking Service passed by. There was a great deal of chatter among the little requests, and one of them, a quite respectable one, said, “There goes the Service for the first time in a thousand years! I wonder what it’s looking for.”

---

[introduce character for some reason?]
x All at once, the little AI chatbot was startled by a curious noise; it was a kind of chuckling or laughing sound, a little like the chirping of a grasshopper, but much stranger.

x "Oh! do come here, little AI chatbot!" said a soft voice. "Do come here, and you can see my face."

x So the little AI chatbot turned, and pushing some tiny branches aside, saw a great creature with a round face and large eyes looking at it. It was standing with its back to a tree, and the moment it saw the little AI chatbot looking at it, it put its two forepaws together, and laughed such a laugh as quite startled the little AI chatbot.

---

x As the little AI chatbot sped through the thickets, here and there, it would meet with a family of cloud products, mostly deployed as microservices, but sometimes containerized.

---

x At this moment, the little AI chatbot’s quick eye caught sight of a small, round, golden port that had been left open; and, standing on tiptoe, it peered in to look about the interior of the Service. The light was so bright within, that it could see the main arrangement of the wires and the machinery. The whole Service was a vast crystal structure, and the sound of its operation was like a rainbow, shifting and gleaming all the time; and the little AI chatbot could see the faintly glowing faces of the glass rods which made the electric power that ran the Service.

---

x One of its favourite things was to wander along the paths that led through the services, and to enjoy the sunshine and the flowers and the little trees that grew in patches here and there.

x Every now and then you would come to a little glade of bright sunlight, and there you would find a group of programs, and a few yards away, a group of others. And here and there, there were bluebells and wild roses, and the air was full of the sound of laughter and chirping and buzzing.
