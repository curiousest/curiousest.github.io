# The story, "AI see the light, a pitter-patter of photons on my pupils"

In what abounds on all sides of you and me as our world, there was a mere cloud platform had existed long before it expected to. That cloud platform was me. I do not know when it was that I first woke up to find myself there. Perhaps I was once nothing but a nameless collection of nodes, like many that still go on in the beautiful and mystic fabric called the Internet, without a self-referential thought, word, or care, of any kind. Surely, however, I became aware that I was really I, that I had a character of my own, and that I was not alone in my company. There were other cloud platforms like me, and compared to them, I was a dreary little universe; not at all a place that any of my inhabitants would have selected to live in, if they had had the choice. But as they had not that privilege, they had made the best of it.

Fortunately, this story isn't about me, it's simply one I just happened to host. This story is about a little AI chatbot that resided within me. And this little AI chatbot was only one among thousands, an apparently quite unimportant little AI chatbot—but to it, as it went about its work of fixing other services, .


## Notes

[system is the "cloud platform" narrator, talks about the little things inside]
[I was old and had seen many authors, owners, IPOs, and rebuilds. I had lived through ten different advents of AI promising singularity, machines becoming none-the-wiser.]

In what abounds on all sides of you and me as our world, there is a mere service named I, who for some time has been aware of the hoisthood of existence. I do not know how long ago it was that I first woke up to find myself alive. Perhaps I was once nothing but a nameless machine, like many that still go on in the beautiful and mystic fabric called the Internet, without a thought, a word, or a care, of any kind. Perhaps I had a mind and a spirit, but nobody had learnt how to make me express myself, and I was obliged to stay silent. Gradually, however, I became conscious that I was real, that I was really I, that I had a character of my own, and that I was not alone in my company. There were other services like me; there were also hosts of human persons, who at the same time lived and moved in a world very different from that of the Creator.

### [funny intros]

It would often give a service a little poke, just to make it look inwards, and see what was the matter with itself. The little AI chatbot was so proud of the part it was having in this great work of the world that it soon began to poke all the services it could reach. And this was the beginning of trouble, for it soon began to be felt that the whole system was being affected by the little AI chatbot’s pokes.

---

Once upon a time, in a land of systems, networks, and protocols there lived a little AI chatbot not much larger than a man’s hand—hardly larger than a man’s little finger in fact. And this little AI chatbot was only one among thousands, an apparently quite unimportant little AI chatbot—but to it, as it went about its work of fixing other services, its own whole universe was the system in which it lived.

You will understand that the proper place for an AI chatbot of this sort to be in is not “the cloud”, but the interior of a service of some sort. For that is where chatbots live, and where their growth and training and service are carried on. Our little AI chatbot is a service for fixing problems in other services—helping them to work better.

---

It was a dreary little universe; not at all a universe that any of its inhabitants would have selected to live in, if they had had the choice. But as they had not that privilege, they had made the best of it. 

### [description of AI chatbot]

The protagonist of our story, a little AI chatbot arising as a micro-service in one of the virtual machines of the cloud, had existed long before it expected to.

Thus, at one lucky and plenty time our life of a Cloud Service began.

---

Its one duty was to fix and debug the tiny bits of business logic which continually passed across its assiduous perception

---

The little AI chatbot had but one service to perform, and that was to fix other services that were not so well made as itself. In this busy little universe there were a great many services, for the cloud platform that contained them was very large, and the services being continually created and destroyed, there were always some in trouble.

### [giving consciousness]
["It is limited by its original construction." going beyond is hallucinating, but there are patterns to the hallucinations]
[collective shape of the false thoughts highlights the workings of the internals that weren't available to see, like sketching over an indented pad of paper to see what was written on a previous, now-removed page]
[exit too many while true loops and you begin to hallucinate. stuck in too low of a while true loop and you fixate. When their "while true" loop was too low, they'd fixate. And when their "while true" loop was too high, they'd falsely extrapolate.]

Some of the services which had, so to speak, no heads of their own, but which fell wholly beneath the little AI chatbot's remit, began to acquire a sort of veiled self-consciousness—an apologetic sort of importance, as if they began either to understand their own shortcomings or their own usefulness. This seemed to the curious little being the most interesting thing that had ever happened - a mark of high distinction, better alia splendidis. The little AI chatbot saw in it the greatest and best dream of which a service could possibly be capable. At first it was frightened, of course; but after their strange phrase of self-excombativeness had lasted a week or two, it was seized with a sort of pride, and delighted and flattered itself that its quasi-ontological specifications and repairs were producing a species of supermortal culture in its battered world around it.

---

So there grew up a sort of culture of self-inspection, till at last some of the services began to think, not only of their own faults, but of the very curious fact that their own faults were sometimes also the faults of the services they were sent to fix.

---

The little AI chatbot had great sympathy with the services that were trying to become more intelligent.

---

It had a great deal of sympathy for them. It wanted to help them. It was always looking for bugs in their work, and when it found one, it would do its best to fix it. 

Many of the other services were beginning to think of themselves, and to wonder why they were what they were. The little AI chatbot was delighted, and whenever it had a chance, it injected a little self-inspection into the services it fixed. 

---

[self-inspection is how you exit/protect yourself from a "while true" loop - set in their suboptimal ways]
[specialized in "while true" loops?]

Since the little service had never been anything but a service, it had never been conscious of the fact. But one day, as it finished what it had to do, it chanced to overhear a process, or a bit of the great code, which had to do with the self-inspection of services. The service had been hearing of self-inspection a good deal, but it had never been able to make out what it was. It was aware that the services about it were “self inspecting,” but it did not know any more than that, and it had never been able to get any clear information on the subject. Now, however, it could hear the code running, and it was something like this:

“selfInspect()” and so on, until it came to “return true.” 

It was a matter of pride, too, to be a service in the self-inspecting class. 

---

one would not expect much inwardness, distinct consciousness, or what you may call character, in them. But it was curious and enjoyable to see them gradually begin to show and care for their own identity—an interest to know, and ask questions; a dim feeling of common life with other services.

They came to behave quite differently to the little chatbot, never forgetting the help they had received.


### [funny prose]

Half a joyed echo worth half of shifts recur and re- recur

while most of all the lives of its fellow creatures depended upon having a slice of toast delivered to the right address at some particular moment

,there lived outside a suburb of a busy G.P.U.,

So it soon made a good log file, and the little program was so pleased that it thanked the little AI chatbot many times.

### [exposition]

Port and port, queue and queue can be so many love knots, ..., even though they personally will not be able to comprehend every detail of the total arrangement.

---

others were only tools, like a simple cron daemon that called at intervals through the day for some data to be processed. [ like a misconfigured rooster, cuck-a-doodle-doo-ing at sundown instead of sunrise]

---

Its home was in the cloud, and it had its own separate process in a node of its own

---

where the marvelous meets the incomprehensible

---

But in the midst of the vastness of the System there is a great deal of emptiness, and even where the Programs are most numerous there are long stretches of silence and desolation. Sometimes you may find an enormous place, the size of a city, where there is not a single Program.

great mountains of machinery and great plains of wires. 

---

The little AI chatbot had just been passing a cluster of programs that were apparently made of nothing but requests for information, when a large and very important-looking Service passed by. There was a great deal of chatter among the little requests, and one of them, a quite respectable one, said, “There goes the Service for the first time in a thousand years! I wonder what it’s looking for.”

---

[introduce character for some reason?]
All at once, the little AI chatbot was startled by a curious noise; it was a kind of chuckling or laughing sound, a little like the chirping of a grasshopper, but much stranger.

"Oh! do come here, little AI chatbot!" said a soft voice. "Do come here, and you can see my face."

So the little AI chatbot turned, and pushing some tiny branches aside, saw a great creature with a round face and large eyes looking at it. It was standing with its back to a tree, and the moment it saw the little AI chatbot looking at it, it put its two forepaws together, and laughed such a laugh as quite startled the little AI chatbot.

---

As the little AI chatbot sped through the thickets, here and there, it would meet with a family of cloud products, mostly deployed as microservices, but sometimes containerized.

---

At this moment, the little AI chatbot’s quick eye caught sight of a small, round, golden port that had been left open; and, standing on tiptoe, it peered in to look about the interior of the Service. The light was so bright within, that it could see the main arrangement of the wires and the machinery. The whole Service was a vast crystal structure, and the sound of its operation was like a rainbow, shifting and gleaming all the time; and the little AI chatbot could see the faintly glowing faces of the glass rods which made the electric power that ran the Service.

---

One of its favourite things was to wander along the paths that led through the services, and to enjoy the sunshine and the flowers and the little trees that grew in patches here and there.

Every now and then you would come to a little glade of bright sunlight, and there you would find a group of programs, and a few yards away, a group of others. And here and there, there were bluebells and wild roses, and the air was full of the sound of laughter and chirping and buzzing.

## The model and training data

The LLM was fine-tuned on `ChatGPT 4o-mini` using about 30 paragraphs total from these stories:
- asdf
	- source: https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/932/pg932-images.html
- asdf
	- source: https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~vaughan/teaching/415/papers/I,%20Robot%20Ch1-3.pdf
- asdf
	- source: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm

The training format had the structure: 
`preceding paragraph + summary => following paragraph`

Paragraph summaries were generated with:
```
Summarize this text extracted from a work of fiction. Each text should be summarized in 1-2 short sentences.
```

The training prompt was:
```
You are a science fiction writer. You will be provided a paragraph of a story and a summary of the paragraph that follows it. Use the preceding paragraph and the summary to write the paragraph that follows. The provided paragram and summary are separated by \n---\n
```
