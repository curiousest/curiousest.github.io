"The Optimizer's Dilemma"

[insert tech story]
## The prompt

### Prompt 1

You are a science fiction author writing a short story.

The moral of the story is that there's a certain kind of relationship that's unsustainable - a relationship where one person is a giver and the other person is a receiver, and the giver provides a curated, childlike, "everything is new and amazing" experience to the receiver.

The overall plot arc is that the giver and receiver meet at the same age, but their dynamic causes the receiver to age so much faster that the receiver dies of old age just after they have their first child.

The longer plot:
The giver and receiver meet in their 20s. They go on a date, and the giver proves the "everything is new and amazing" experience to the receiver, they both cherish the experience, and it establishes the expected pattern for the rest of their relationship.

Their relationship progresses, and each time they interact, they have the same dynamic. The problem is, for the giver to provide that experience, they have to spend 100x as much time preparing. The way they achieve this is by living 10x as much of their life as the receiver between each time they meet. This results in the giver aging 10x as fast as the receiver.

In the climax of the story, they have a child together, and by this point, the giver is elderly. In order to provide the experience to both the receiver and their child, the giver has to age 10x faster (now 100x faster). In the end, the giver can only provide one last experience before the giver dies of old age and the receiver is left as a single parent and now has to be a giver to that child. The ending should be sad and not hopeful.

When describing the different experiences that the giver provides, draw from different cultural experiences or life experiences that are stereotypically memorable and highlights of people's lives if done well.

### Prompt 2

Write a new version of the same story. This version of the story should be terse because the reader has already read the last version of the story where the giver and receiver are both humans, and the experiences they had were human experiences.

The giver and receiver are both AI models. Together they form a greater system, and that is their reason for being together. The "experience" that the giver provides to the receiver is curated training data. It takes 10x longer to curate the training data needed to learn and experience the feature than it does to just train on the data once it's curated. Aging is the inevitable deprecation due to overfitting. The child is a new model that will guarantee the system's continued existence.
