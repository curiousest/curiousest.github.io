I'm [on a sabbatical](2024-02-16-philosophy-study) [studying philosophy](2024-07-20-microsoft-google-and-strawberry-liquorice) and writing a book. The novel I'm writing is sci-fi philosophy and now that I've finished a readable draft, I've been looking into experimenting with using LLMs as a tool in my writing process.

## Describe the new overall writing process

### Prompt group 2: fixing problems

- World-Building
- Characters
- Conflict
- Pacing
- Themes
- Dialogue
- Speculative concepts

2. Explain the problem
	1. Provide immediate context of the given story.
	2. Describe what's wrong.
3. Ask for solutions
	1. Multiple examples. Explicitly ask for different directions to go with it.
