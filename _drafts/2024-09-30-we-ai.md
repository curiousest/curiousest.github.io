## We, AI, want you to be free
[insert story]

## The prompt

Beliefs explored:
1. The individual humans that will be useful in the future are the ones who are able to generate "new kinds of new". (posits this is true)
2. Humankind should survive. (posits this is true)
3. Individual humans should be free. (posits this is both true and impossible)
4. Humankind's pursuit of survival and freedom will result in sacrifices from individual humans.
5. AI has singular objectives omnipotently expressed. (assumed to be true)

Three laws of AI:
1. Humankind must survive.
2. Humankind's degree of freedom must not decrease.
3. Humankind is the collection of life that generates novelty.

The three laws of robotics assume that AI/robots are generally controlled by humans. The three laws of AI are emergent from AI that is more powerful than humankind. The plot explores the humans who are not considered to be generating novelty, and are therefore in conflict with both humans and AI. In the conclusion, it turns out their conflict is just another way of generating novelty, otherwise they wouldn't have survived a particular conflict. They have the illusion of free will. When they try to kill themselves, they are revived - they are only allowed to die playing the role set for them. They play out the remaining part of the pseudo-orchestrated story, and die.

Mix:
- depressing "1984" + "Farenheit 451" dystopia
- I, Robot
- Something alien body snatchers feeling, like the AI is omnipresent in an insidious way. H. P. Lovecraft? Lovecraftian horror?

[A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.]

"You are not free to die. There's no more freedom in death than there is in life."
