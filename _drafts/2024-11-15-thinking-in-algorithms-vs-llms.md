You think in algorithms. Try thinking in LLMs.

What does that mean? When you're in a situation like this:

"I need someone to schedule interviews for me."

Instead of thinking like this:
> First, check if there's a free weekday 30min slot between 9-5.
> Make sure it's not during lunch (12-1).
> Make sure it's not first thing in the morning.
> Sometimes I can do 8-9 or 5-7, depending if it's booked, or if I've been busy the last couple days.
> etc...

Try also approaching it like this:
> Here are some examples of what I booked and what my calendar looked like when I booked it.
> Pay attention to the urgency/priority of the events.

^ notice how my framing of that whole thing was also "thinking in LLMs" rather than algorithmically. I could have framed all that as an algorithm: "when you're about to do some work, check whether you're approaching the problem algorithmically. If you are, then think about whether you can instead do something like `f"Given {conditions}, respond with {n-shot prompt template}"`.

If you feel resistance, and the first thing that comes to mind is, "isn't everything an algorithm, even this supposed *thinking in LLMs*?"
Then you would really benefit from trying to think in LLMs.
## Story 1: Running a team. The hole in your mind where LLMs could be.

I was telling my friend "Story 2" below, and he said,

"I don't know how I'd apply that at work. Like, I have this system in my head, and I wouldn't even be able to explain it to another person."

"Ok," I said, "but you're about to hire a team to help you build that system in your head, so how are you going to get them to help?"

not a good argument that cap is a best thing
just imagine there's something better, what do you think that would be?

just imagine there's a better way of thinking, and it has something to do with thinking like LLMs, what do you think that would look like?
