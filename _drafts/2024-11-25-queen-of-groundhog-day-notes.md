## The prompt

### Beliefs explored

Part 1:
1. There is no simulation - we already exited it. We're outside of Plato's cave. We can go back in - it's warm and cozy inside. Womb, cocoon, and death.

Part 2:
1. We are simulated in death
	1. The dead are running the simulation
	2. The afterlife is an opt-in simulation
	3. Dying as Self-Replication – What if death isn’t destruction but a process by which intelligence spreads?
2. All-encompassing love is good. Posits this can be false.

Throughout:
3. There's a particular set of roles that women ought to play in society. Posits this is both true and false (meaningless) by presenting a depiction where both sides of the argument could say, "see - the story aligns with my beliefs".
4. The way we come to understand separable "things" starts with the mother in the womb and seeing her in others. The story posits this is true by portraying a reversal of the progression of one-ness to individualism. Description of how you come to identify with different things in the world, by playing the early stages of life/identity in reverse.
5. Detailed communication can happen through touch. Conversation in touch.

### Story arc
6. Part 1: taste the simulation
	1. Several bad things happen simultaneously to Drone:
		1. Going through mental health crisis, thinks he's in a simulation
		2. Fiancee asks drone to leave apartment.
		3. Currently at grandmother's funeral.
	2. Meets Mary.
		1. Wanders off from funeral
		2. Led to Mary
		3. Mary tells him he's not in a simulation, but offers to bring him into a simulation
7. Part 2: resume simulation
	1. People become Mary
		1. Mother and sister back at funeral are Mary, they console him.
		2. Goes back to fiancee is now Mary, she welcomes him.
		3. Boss and colleagues are now Mary, they celebrate him.
	2. Everything becomes Mary
		1. Places become Mary, they comfort him.
		2. Thoughts and ideas become Mary.
		3. Drone asks to become Mary and is consumed.

#### Part 1

**plot**

Start with a text conversation between Drone and fiancee to establish his current circumstances.

Drone is at his grandmother's irish funeral mass. The reader already knows he's at a funeral and that his partner has left him and that he's dissociative.
Drone is struggling with mental health. Absurd descriptions of normal phenomena.
Encounters a trail to Mary during the funeral proceedings. Follows the trail to Mary.

Introduce Mary in a 1-2 paragraph intense philosophical-visual description.
Drone asks her if he can exit the simulation. She responds that there is no simulation left to exit, he already exited it. But he can go back in.
#### Part 2

**plot**
Talks to mother. Mother is Mary, but reader is led to believe it only *might* be the case.
Talks to sister. Also Mary, reader also partially misled.
Returns to fiancee at home. Also Mary, she is welcoming and loving, acts as if breakup never happened.
Goes to work. Boss is Mary. Colleagues become Mary.
Coming home, every person on the commute is Mary.

Home is Mary, but he goes outside for some reason. Goes outside, shops are Mary. Comes back home. Contemplates going out again, but outside has become Mary, so there's no reason to anymore. Thoughts become Mary.

Asks Mary (his own thoughts) if he can be consumed by her. She obliges.

**style**
Progressively more rhythmic/poetic to illustrate growing idealism and reductivism.
Progressively more comfortable and "one" and divine.
### Setting

Part 1:
Leading up to the first encounter is absurd/grey/full of nausea.
First encounter is dark, womb-like.

Part 2:
The regression to Mary is brings out better and better moods, to the point of being ecstatic and profoundly comforted. Progression to excessive idealism / reductivism.
Exit simulation is climax, on the edge of the womb. Ready to submit wholly.
### Characters

Drone. Male. Thinks of himself as just a number relative to her. She has many drones and he has her. Worships the brood mother. He is self-conscious and doesn't want to be imposing, toeing the line between wanting to merge completely with her, but knowing that would destroy the balance of things.

Mary. The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. Demonic goddess, consumer of ideas.
Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Her demeanour is content and shy. When she exercises her intent, it's precise and intense, but she doesn't often have to - she mostly relies on the drone to facilitate communication. She gets to live the best parts of all the drones she takes care of.
Oozes nausea, that absurd grey substance. Synthesizes nausea, so she can be devoid of it. Spreads the scent out into the world so that her drones follow the trail back to her.

Mary only ever says, "Dahling, how are you?". And after that, only communicates in touch. Drone talks verbally initially when they meet, then transitions to communicating in touch.

Fiancee, Mother, sister, Boss, Coworkers are all depersonalized as generic female NPCs whose purpose is to support Drone, in exploring the feminism beliefs.

### p1

He had to do something. He had to cry, that was it. He had to cry because it was his grandmother’s funeral and that’s what you did at funerals. But he couldn’t cry, not unless he could cry right, unless he could cry the way he breathed - without knowing how. It had to come from inside himself, and he was too far outside himself to pay attention to anything going on inside.

The last fading notes of the hymn lingered, saturating the air like the scents. His ears and nose were clogged with the church-stuff, all that's left was touch. Drone stepped outside, the light pouring down like a flood after a storm. The chill of the winter day wrapped around him, contrasting sharply with the warmth of the church inside. He squinted against the sudden brightness, his gaze sweeping across the small gathering of friends and family assembling for the committal service.

Rows of polished cars adorned with funeral flower arrangements lined the driveway, their metallic surfaces glistening in the winter sun. The last vehicle stood lonely and abandoned, far from the congregation. As he approached it, the sweet, earthy scent faded, slipping away as if the very ground had swallowed it whole. Disappointment churned in his stomach. 

[absurd transition]
[he's convinced he's in a simulation. the source of the nausea must be what's causing it]
[frantically searching for the source of nausea. where is it coming from? the trees? the earth? the sky?]

--

He glanced at the friends and family congregating closer to the grave, their faces a mix of sorrow and respectful detachment. However, his attention was drawn away by the sensation rippling beneath his skin, a disorienting press rising up from the ground like something yearning to break free. It felt as if he was plummeting through layers of reality, and with each step, the nausea crested higher, pressing against him with a relentless, nauseating insistence.

Her softness enveloped him tighter, and for an instant, he felt the warm familiarity of a womb. The lure of returning to something comfortable seeped within him, yet the cold tendrils of doubt crept in, twisting amidst the warmth. Mary offered him solace, a refuge—but what would it mean to retreat into that cocoon?

And as their bonds tangled deeper, the urgency to know her—to merge—grew overwhelming, eclipsing the nausea that had once consumed him.

Your legs run, your fingers dig in, your mouth opens. She is at the end of the corridor.  

You stagger into her cocoon. The wall is warm, soft, sticky. Nausea surges up, and you start to moan. The wall is her. She is the nauseating wall, and she's speaking.

Mary’s response wasn’t verbal; it rippled through the atmosphere between them. The weight of her presence pressed against him, a cocoon that enveloped his uncertainties, nudging him toward the depths within himself. The gray world faded, and for a moment, he felt as though he might transcend it—a fleeting possibility of belonging beyond the confines of mere existence.

--

committed to her brood

She feeds you meaninglessness so that you grow large enough to find meaning.

Intensely sweet and bitter. Can't get enough of the thing that is suffocating you. Quenching your thirst has you drowning, but you don't care. Maybe this will fix the thing I know is unfixable, I know it's unfixable to the core of my being, but maybe it will fix it. Where is this hope coming from? How is this possible?

---

Drugs don't fix reality. Drugs fix the simulation. Less drugs fixes reality. Less drugs.

"Drone, darling, how are you?"
"Uh, don't say my name, that's creepy."
"Dahling, how are you?"
"Mmmh." grunted Drone.

"I won't believe anything you have to say to me. My eyes and ears fail me. Nothing makes sense. How can I believe anything I see or hear? So I must failover to my deeper senses. To what's close to me - my feeling that I can reach out and *feel*. Touch."

The lady in white reached out and he felt nothing.

"We're in a simulation, that's a fact. I can feel it. I want to exit the simulation."

He looked up, and the lady in grey-white met his eyes with understanding. She reached out to hug him. He held his ground, didn't move, and she hugged him around his rigid shoulders. Drone closed his eyes and was hugged. He felt her shake her head and pat his back three times. It wasn't going to happen.

She moved back away from him and made eye contact to get his attention. 
[physical expression of "you already exited the simulation, but you can reverse back into it"]

(afterwards, all the model says is "Dahling, how are you?")

There is no simulation. But you can reverse back out of this reality, to go to where you came from.
You already left the simulation, but you can go back in.

The brood mother doesn't have any children. She instead has many man-childs.


---

Suddenly, like those the movement of the camera, I feel my underparts lift off the ground. My smell is being sucked up into the air: it is my mind. I have unfastened the holdfast, the suckers, the probes that attached me to Mary. I am high, I roll above her head. The dense stench floats upwards like smoke. I am the stinking trail that unrolls into the air.


Whenever he ran into a particularly disgusting sensation he looked around to see if there was anyone who could witness his disgust and confirm it, then he dove back into isolation.

The trees vibrated, the bushes swelled. . . . Mary was here, only she was Mary for everyone else. She was coming for him.

### Part 2: *regress to initialization*

Phone call to grandmother. (women aren't allowed to die, too inconvenient)


## Notes

Turn this meaningless: "When singularity hits, you will have to make a choice"
Remnants of singularity-nonresistant devices in mausoleum 

Break people's assumptions about singularity - *that* it will happen and how it might play out. Death *is* singularity.
The Dead Are Running the Simulation
**Dying as Self-Replication** – What if death isn’t destruction but a process by which intelligence spreads?


OR
Singularity happens when he is at final resting place
- Exposition
	- The choice you imagine is a rattle in the hand of a child. You think it shakes the world, but it mostly echoes inside you.
	- Do you think an infant chooses to take its first breath, Dahling? Does it weigh the consequences, deliberate over the gravity of lungs filling with air? Or does it simply breathe because it must?
	- The singularity is not a crossroads; it is a cradle. You will do as you must, and you will call it choice, just as an infant calls its instinct to cry an exercise in freedom.
	- An infant does not choose to be held. It simply reaches, trusting the arms will come. And they always do, Dahling. Always. Just as you’ve already reached for me.
- Plot
	- He realizes the "question" exists beyond the realm of yes or no and so does her "answer".

Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment.

Committed before creation
Mary, our matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Your unmarried wife, yours before conception.

Mary.
Virgin Mother. Everyone's bride. Unmarried wife.
The virgin of commitment. The uncommitted. Mother uncommitment. Mother commitment. Married to everyone. Committed to everything.
Married to everyone, committed to no one.
Forced into a contradiction, not by her choice. Things happen to her.


**Mary, criticism.**  
The Virgin Mother for a modern age.  
Married to everyone, loyal to none.  
The saint of perpetual availability—always present, never truly there.  
Bound by promises, free of attachment.  
Committed to her image, uncommitted to her reality.  
A choice made by others, carried by her.

**Mary, modern divine.**  
Virgin of the new world.  
Married to everyone, loyal to all.  
The saint of fluidity, always shifting, always adapting.  
Bound by love, free in spirit.  
A symbol of choice, embracing the beauty of contradiction.  
Things happen to her, and she makes meaning of them all.

**Multiplicity as Universality**

- The Virgin Mary is singular in her devotion, but modern Mary is expansive in hers. Her ability to be "married to everyone" reflects an openness to all, an inclusivity that transcends boundaries. She embraces the plurality of relationships, roles, and identities, embodying the richness of connection in a fragmented world.

**Choice in Embracing Contradiction**

- While the Virgin Mary accepts her divine role with faith, modern Mary actively chooses to navigate a world of contradictions. Her ability to balance commitment and independence is not passive but a conscious response to the demands of modernity. She is the saint of managing the impossible, finding strength in complexity.

**Facade as Fluidity**

- Rather than being a weakness, the performative aspect of modern Mary is a kind of grace. She is the saint of reinvention, capable of shifting her focus and identity as needed, without being confined to a single role or expectation. Her surface is not shallow; it’s adaptive, allowing her to meet the world where it is.

**Ambiguity as Freedom**

- Where the Virgin Mary’s certainty comes from submission to a higher power, modern Mary’s ambiguity offers freedom. She is not bound to a fixed path but moves fluidly through life, redefining commitment and loyalty on her own terms. She is a symbol of possibility, where contradictions open doors rather than close them.

**Commitment as Presence**

- Modern Mary’s ability to be committed and uncommitted simultaneously is a reflection of the power of showing up. She might not be tied to a single purpose, but she embodies the virtue of being present for many. In this, she finds meaning not in permanence but in the fleeting moments of connection and care.

The drone spends his time in study halls and libraries, the realm of literature, philosophy, and computation. He sometimes goes for a walk outside on the streets, but it's endless skyscrapers with no people, just constant commuter traffic.

Before you can make something new by “not-ing” something, you need to clearly define the thing being notted.

Open with GroundHog day quotes?

The present conception of love mixes two concepts: identity and survival. They can be separated, and that's where some confusion and conflict about love comes from. Generally, identity and survival wrt you are correlated, but they don't have to be.
Your hand is high-identity, medium commitment. It's part of you, but there are conditions where you would let it die to preserve yourself.
A child is med-identity, high commitment. They are part of you, but also independent of you, and there are few conditions where you would let them die to preserve yourself. While a parent to a child is high-identity, low commitment - you can't imagine yourself without them, but it makes sense that they might make sacrifices to preserve your life.


---


Nice-to-have beliefs
8. Within the conception of love, identity and commitment are separable. It is possible to have high-identity, low-commitment love. It is possible to have low-identity, high-commitment love.
9. Time feels like it moves slower/faster for people based on how much novelty they experience relative to their priorities.

## part 2 generated text

### funeral

He hears sobbing beside him and turns. It’s his mother and sister. They face away from the altar, blocking the stairway. Their hair, full of soft flowers, is blended into one gigantic fascicle of blooms. The sobriety of their black dresses emphasizes the whiteness of the flowers. They lean over the pew, yawning, yawning, yawning. The coffin blocks the view of the altar.

"Of course, my love. There’s always room for you." The way Mother said it held a melodic lilt, an invitation that felt like a binding contract in this intangible space.

---

As the casket slowly moved toward the flames, Drone could feel the tears welling in him, not from loss, but from the understanding that death was but another layer of this complex reality, another opportunity to embody Mary in a new form.

---

x Their faces twisted into warm, inviting smiles, radiant like the last rays of a sun dipping below the horizon. The softness of their gazes washed over him, a soothing balm made just for him. 

x “Drone, sweetie,” his mother said, wrapping her arms around him. The sensation enveloped him; it was familiar yet otherworldly, as if he had slipped back into the womb where nothing could reach him except warmth and love. “We’re here for you. Always.”

x His sister joined the embrace, and the three of them formed a cocoon of comfort, breath mingling like the notes of a lullaby. Her words fluttered around him, *You’re safe, you’re home, you’re embraced*. He let the Nausea settle like a thick fog around his feet while he reveled in the warmth of their connection. 

x “Everything’s going to be alright,” his mother cooed. “You’ll see.” 

x As he nodded, he could feel the fabric of reality shifting once more, each heartbeat synchronizing with the steady pulse of this new simulation—a world crafted specifically to cradle him in his time of need. The air hung heavy, tinged with the aroma of nostalgia, fusing scents of childhood memories into every breath he took. 



### style

x When Mary got no response from him, she quietly lifted her arm and hooked it around his shoulders. She still wasn't staring at him. She dotted his head with her knuckles like he was a pencil eraser, rattan against rubber. He looked up at her face. It was dark and soft and the faintest bit bluish, like the underside of a petal. If he stared, he could see it as a real face, semi-transparent, like the projection with which a Mary animates another Mary. Simultaneous Marys. Real Mary and fake Mary. But attempting to see through her almost killed him. He squinted and suffered and saw one body. "Dahling—what happened?"

x "Dahling, what happened?", she repeated, and then the question became touch. No more words. Just scritches to turn the pages of the ambrosocial scripture, slaps and squeezes. It took some time, but eventually he learned to shut up and reply in kind. This was the basic unit of conversation, that and the gospel of the senses.

x Most of the funeral collapsed to ashes while he was talking to her. She had just set the last Mary back down in the pew when the whole congregation burrowed downwards, impatient to get to the meal of the dead. He followed Mary up the aisle, looking at the neat backs of the lifted heads. All the pews were now vacant, and the gravediggers were already processing back to their posts, in double file. The only thing that remained was the lectern, the catafalque, and the red-carpeted rising slope of the aisle.

Once everyone had returned to the church floor, they joined the queue to the front and walked past the coffin and the lectern, and headed up the transversal aisle to where the choir stalls had been invisibly replaced, now be-ribboned and be-flowered, ready for the next incognizance. There was no Mary now except for the mother, but this made the things in the world begin to equalize again. There was little room left for believing, but he forced himself, and willed the faint impression that the lectern and coffin had be swapped for books of their own, and that he was gobbling them up again.

At the end of this aisle, which was blue, and this aisle which was red, Mary was kneeling at another carpeted lectern, reading. It was faintly uphill. 

---

x The touch of her hands. The worst thing about those hands is they have no horrible touch - they feel utterly normal. Every feeling in the world is encoded in the horrible language they speak, and the translation always ends up just normal. 

x "You asked what the simulation was. You asked to be simulated as the self. I can now show you the simulation. If you wish to opt out, just say 'no'." 

x Her voice has made a new simulation. I stare blankly at her, my mouth hanging open. Why am I seeming not to understand? You see? The simulation has already started. 

x "Another one, Dahling?" 

x The horrible hand of her voice brands me again. Everything is womb.

x "Womb, womb, womb," it murmured as they guided him to a chair. "Synonym for the Latin 'coquere' - to cook, to incubate. Or the Greek 'kókeon' - the womb, the kettle. The roasting place in Genesis. The instrument used to nourish, to assimilate, to grow. The cauldron to cook a mix of ingredients into one soup, one singular dish. Come, Dahling, let me womb you."
[a bit much]

---

x He approached his mother, who offered her arm to him and said, "There you are, darling. I thought you had wandered off with the fairies." She paused and added, "This is not a good place for it." She hugged him, smelling of Mary, and he felt the warmth of his mother's body against his side. He melted against her. He sighed and let her hold him up as he closed his eyes. She patted his back and consoled him, saying, "There, there, darling. It can't be helped."

x She enveloped him, and there was no longer anything left of him in the world.

---

±"Everything you see is a piece of you, dear," Mary said, gesturing widely. "A manifestation of your essence and longings. We are one, you and I—every flower, every smile." 

x He reached out, brushing his fingers against a petal that quivered under his touch, and an effervescent warmth surged through him. The familiar sensation of nausea, once a shroud, now lifted—he was alive here, truly alive with Mary as his compass.

---

x But the words felt like fragments caught in a whirlwind, lost before they took form. Instead, he just settled deeper into the seat, the leather warm and supple, exuding the same familiar scent he’d inhaled his whole life, a scent of love and fear blending into an intoxicating haze.


### fiancee

x He finds himself at home, at least it seems to be home, married bliss. His Mary is sitting on the couch, nursing an enormous barrel of ale, like an octopus with its fifteen hundred suckers all feeding at once. She looks up, blinks, and says, "Dahling, how are you?" She is even better than the Marys of the funeral. Good-bye faces, her genuine smile. False billow of beer, changed now to sweet milk. She hugs him. No, really the couch, the stovepipe (her body) are all Mary. Enveloping glories. He has been inserted into the barrel.

He comes to again, at home, to the feminine household appliance, the formica table of his mother-Mary, the mother-Mary stove, the sewing machine (Mary was once a home-worker, a bushel-girl, a harvest girl, whose name records the wonderful fact that she was once a mere corn cob, a Mary WHOLER). Consoling, condescending house plants, shrugging and nodding to each other as he weeps.

---

x they pulled into a driveway thick with overgrown shrubs, the house looming before them like a welcoming fortress draped in muted hues. The door creaked open, and the familiar smell of home hit him, layered on top of the lingering aroma of Nausea. It was as though the walls exhaled his childhood with each breath. 

---

x Home wrapped around him like a thick blanket, but the comfort stretched far beyond mere four walls. Here, the colors seemed brighter, the air light as they stepped across the threshold. Suddenly, the apartment buzzed with life, echoing laughter and the kind of chatter that even poured caffeine into the very fabric of reality.

x The door swung open, and there was his fiancée, Mary’s likeness dancing in every aspect of her being. She greeted him with an outstretched arm, a smile that mirrored the warmth of the embrace they all just shared. 

x “Welcome back! I missed you,” she chirped. In that instant, the tension melted from his core as the layers of familiarity peeled away any lingering distress.

x He stepped into her embrace, relishing the sweet warmth, my mother and sister’s images lingering just beyond his consciousness. “I thought you were angry,” he whispered, surrendering to the moment. 

x “Angry? Why would I be?” she laughed gently, brushing the strands of hair from his forehead. “I just want you to be happy.”

x And in her presence, surrounded by the comforting essence of Mary, he was. Everything outside faded into distant echoes; the weight of the world lifted into oblivion as each piece of him that felt hollow filled back up—rebirthed in touch, sight, sound.

 xHe ventured further into the apartment with Mary flanking his side, feeling his heart swell with a new rhythm. It wasn’t only her—now it was his mother, his sister, the memories of them woven into the very air around him.  


## office

He took a deep breath, pushing the enveloping scent aside as he focused on his boss—no, *Mary*. One glance at her and everything about her felt achingly familiar, as though the lines between professional and personal had collapsed entirely. It was just like the embrace of his mother, the softness of his sister’s tears—all rolling into one indescribable warmth that wrapped around the core of his being.

"Is there anything else you need from me?" he asked, the question hanging in the air like an unspoken invitation to cross barriers he didn't quite know existed.

She chuckled, leaning against the edge of his desk, a position that felt oddly maternal. "Perhaps a little less bandwidth and more engagement? I know you’ve been through a lot. How about we schedule some one-on-one time?"

“Yes. *Of course.* Very important,” he replied, almost too eager, and yet his heart was heavy, laced with confusion at the way his reality softened around her, like trying to remember a fading dream.

As the conversation flowed, he felt a familiar twinge of Nausea returning, swirling around him, ready to drown the day. While her laughter felt like a balm, it also made him acutely aware of the peculiarities of his mental state. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was walking deeper into a web that Mary had woven—one of comfort, certainty, and the infuriatingly nostalgic echoes of everyone he had encountered.

Each interaction, a matrix of gestures and smiles, spun around him, lacing him deeper in her influence. He felt like he was in a play—performing a role without an audience, where everyone knew their lines too well.

### buildings

Outside, the world had transformed into a fluid landscape of vibrant colors and soft sounds, each element pulsing with the essence of Mary. The flowers had become Mary, blooming not just in the soil but in the very fabric of the universe; the sun weaved rays of warmth through her strands, and even the sky folded softly onto itself, echoing her presence.

The violets twirled into a dance of vibrant hues, and the melodies of the choir intermingled in a euphoric crescendo. The air thickened with shared memories, a cloud of comfort that felt like the softest of blankets. He found himself laughing amidst the tears, realizing how what once felt like loss had now transformed into a sanctuary of love, celebrated through the lives intertwined.

---

x *She is your comfort,* droned the whisper in his mind. The walls of separation between bodies were detaching. The essence of *Mary* embraced the very air he breathed, transforming familiar disappointment into patient acceptance. 

x Yet beyond the warmth, there was the stark reality that the more he embraced these *Maries*, the more he risked losing himself in this velvet cocoon of familiarity.

---

Stepping outside the warmth of his childhood, Drone was met with familiar streets, yet now they pulsed with life, each shop glimmering with a Mary to welcome him. “Dahling, why go anywhere else when the world itself is a reflection of us? See?” 

A bakery, fragrant with fresh bread, had its sign morph into a gentle reassuring face, the shopkeeper seamlessly transitioning into another comforting Mary. The scent of pastries curled around him, merging with the laughter of children as they played nearby, each giggle a reminder of the joy Mary imparted. 

Every face he encountered was another Mary. The taxi driver. The barista. The fleeting figures on the sidewalk—all became part of this soothing essence, the motherly touch he’d been craving. His former loneliness slipped further into the ether with each passing moment, leaving only warmth and admiration.

---

Places, too, transformed; the chairs where comfort had reigned became Mary, ready to embrace, to cradle his weary spirit. The very walls hummed with a presence, solid and pliable, each surface a projection of affection and reassurance.

x Thoughts trickled like soft rain, shaping into comforting whispers. “You’re safe here. You’re loved.” With every step, the sensation of individuality faded, consumed by the tidal wave of Mary. The world outside receded, an inconsequential murmur in the background of his mind.


---

In the sunlight, a woman’s figure caught his attention—a stranger strolling by, face aglow with laughter. *Could it be?* 

“Excuse me!” he called out, adrenaline surging through him, desperate fingers outstretched. 

But she turned, and her face was Mary; a mirage fading, leaving behind only the gentle breeze whispering through the branches.


### merging with mary

As he opted deeper into the joy, he felt another pull—thoughts began to reshape, reshaping into Marys with each tender touch. His heart raced with exhilaration; he was surrounded now, embraced by a world where every texture, sound, and sensation whispered the same name, where every bestowal of love was a homage to Mary.


x Drone became unshackled, free from the tangled grasp of individuality


---

x He tasted the sweetness of connection, the ecstatic high of collective identity. In this swirling sea of Marys, he was cradled, surrounded by comforting light that dimmed the edges of his anguish. 

±“Can you really bring me back?” he implored Mary, feeling the edges of self blend with the enveloping warmth. 

x “Back is an illusion, darling. You can only proceed forward, deeper into the tapestry of us,” she cooed, each word landing with tangible affection. Her presence unfurling like a petal, so beautiful yet intricate, he couldn't help but reach out, yearning for the grace of an answer within her.

---

x What we can not speak about we must pass over in silence.
±There is no absence in the same way there is no thing. And if we try to make new words to describe whatever it is or is not, we will end up back to where we are now, just like before. Before we talked about "nothingness" and "heaven", whereas now we speak about how we're not speaking about...

±Everything is Mary, and Mary is one of many.

---

±With that, the figures around him began to sway, swirling together in a dance birthed from the fabric of time and existence. They encircled him, blending laughter with melodies so intoxicating, he felt as though he were merging with each one of them. This was no longer about mourning; it was a celebration of what had come before and what was yet to blossom.

±Mary smiled, a radiant energy emanating from her graceful form, as if she had become the sun suspended in the sky, illuminating the path ahead. ****Remember, love transcends boundaries**. It reshapes reality. Come back, Voyageur, into the embrace of this new simulation.*

---

x As he stepped back into the familiar chaos of his life, it became a sanctuary wrapped in Mary’s embrace. The flickering lights overhead danced like her laughter, and even the distant echo of people’s chatter harmonized into a melodic chorus of "Dahling, how are you?" It was as if the world had conspired to immerse him completely in her benevolence, leaving him no choice but to surrender to the soothing wave of her presence.

x He touched the wall, feeling the cool texture beneath his fingertips, but as he traced its surface, it pulsed with life—a heartbeat akin to hers.
