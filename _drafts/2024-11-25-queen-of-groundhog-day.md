## The Queen of Groundhog Day

Today is the day she eats me, finally. I don't have to worry about tomorrow because today I am hers.

I don't have to relive today anymore, she's taking me out of groundhog day.

There's no pleasure like the relief of the deepest pain.
## The prompt

### Beliefs explored

1. There's a cocoon-like layer and framing of the world that keeps you safe and holds you back from experiencing reality. Breaking through it will lead to extreme feelings, for example, feeling like you've died.
2. Detailed communication can happen through touch. Conversation in touch.
3. Within the conception of love, identity and commitment are separable. It is possible to have high-identity, low-commitment love. It is possible to have low-identity, high-commitment love.
4. Time feels like it moves slower/faster for people based on how much novelty they experience relative to their priorities.
### Outline

Story arc:
1. The drone anticipates meeting the Queen of Groundhog Day.
2. They meet, and misconceptions of the Queen are resolved.
3. The Queen consumes the drone as he desires.

The drone has been living the same day over and over like Groundhog Day. The Queen of Groundhog Day owns the simulation that the drone relives. It has cocoon-like qualities, like feeling safe but not offering quite enough stimulation. Most of what's available for the drone to newly learn comes from outside the cocoon. The drone experiences hundreds of years for every day that passes for the Queen. He takes care to condense his centuries into short text, so that the Queen isn't overloaded with 

At first, his simplified presentation and conception of the Queen makes her seem like she's taking advantage of him. But as real-life interactions proceed, she's actually very happy to what he likes, and all this is her facilitating his desires.
### Setting
The drone spends his time in study halls and libraries, the realm of literature, philosophy, and computation. He sometimes goes for a walk outside on the streets, but it's endless skyscrapers with no people, just constant commuter traffic.
### Characters
The characters are humanoid. 

The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Demonic goddess, consumer of ideas. Her demeanour is content and shy. When she exercises her intent, it's precise and intense, but she doesn't often have to - she mostly relies on the drone to facilitate communication. She gets to live the best parts of all the drones she takes care of.

The drone. Male. Thinks of himself as just a number relative to her. She has many drones and he has her. Worships the brood mother. He is self-conscious and doesn't want to be imposing, toeing the line between wanting to merge completely with her, but knowing that would destroy the balance of things.

They communicate in two methods.
1. Remotely, via text.
2. In-person, via touch.

## Notes

And he ceased to feel. And it was optimal.

Before you can make something new by “not-ing” something, you need to clearly define the thing being notted.

Make it unclear whether the day ends when he is eaten or when his day is over or both...
Open with GroundHog day quotes?

The present conception of love mixes two concepts: identity and survival. They can be separated, and that's where some confusion and conflict about love comes from. Generally, identity and survival wrt you are correlated, but they don't have to be.
Your hand is high-identity, medium commitment. It's part of you, but there are conditions where you would let it die to preserve yourself.
A child is med-identity, high commitment. They are part of you, but also independent of you, and there are few conditions where you would let them die to preserve yourself. While a parent to a child is high-identity, low commitment - you can't imagine yourself without them, but it makes sense that they might make sacrifices to preserve your life.


Rose tinted glasses don’t change. Drone is consumed and it’s seen as a good thing. Queen absorbs drones identity. Drone doesn’t know, but when they do, it’s the perfect thing.

The brood mother doesn't have any children. She instead has many man-childs.

The deepest suffering you can endure is monotony. Not just because of the daily grind, but also because when you finally break away, the pain of novelty

## Sartre "Nausea"

I can’t say I feel relieved or satisfied ; just the opposite, I am crushed. Only my goal is reached : I know what I wanted to know ; I have understood all that has happened to me since January. The Nausea has not left me and I don’t believe it will leave me so soon ; but I no longer have to bear it, it is no longer an illness or a passing fit : it is I. 

So I was in the park just now. The roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench. I couldn't remember it was a root any more. The words had vanished and with them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their surface. I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty mass, entirely beastly, which frightened me. Then I had this vision. It left me breathless.

There is nothing much to say : I could not pick up the paper, that’s all

I very much like to pick up chestnuts, old rags and especially papers. It is pleasant to me to pick them up, to close my hand on them ; with a little encouragement I would carry them to my mouth the way children do. Anny went into a white rage when I picked up the comers of heavy, sumptuous papers, probably soiled by excrement. In summer or the beginning of autumn, you can find remnants of sun-baked newspapers in gardens, dry and fragile as dead leaves, so yellow you might 18 think they had been washed with picric acid. In winter, some pages are pounded to pulp; crushed, stained, they return to the earth. Others quite new when covered with ice, all white, all throbbing, are like swans about to fly, but the earth has already caught them from below. They twist and tear themselves from the mud, only to be finally flattened out a little further on. It is good to pick up all that. Sometimes I simply feel them, looking at them closely ; other times I tear them to hear their drawn out crackling, or, if they are damp, I light them, not without difficulty ; then I wipe my muddy hands on a wall or tree trunk

So, today, I was watching the riding boots of a cavalry officer who was leaving his barracks. As I followed them with my eyes, I saw a piece of paper lying beside a puddle. I thought the officer was going to crush the paper into the mud with his heel, but no : he straddled paper and puddle in a single step. I went up to it : it was a lined page, undoubtedly torn from a school notebook. The rain had drenched and twisted it, it was covered with blisters and swellings like a burned hand. The red line of the margin was smeared into a pink splotch ; the ink had run in places. The bottom of the page disappeared beneath a crust of mud. I bent down, already rejoicing at the touch of this pulp, fresh and tender, which I should roll in my fingers into greyish balls ... I was

I stayed bent down for a second, I read “ Dictation : TheWhite Owl ”, then I straightened up, empty-handed. I am no longer free, I can no longer do what I will. Objects should not touch because they are not alive. You use them, put them back in place, you live among them : they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it is unbearable. I am afraid of being in contact with them as though they were living beasts. Now I see : I recall better what I felt the other day at the seashore when I held the pebble. It was a sort of sweetish 19 sickness. How unpleasant it was! It came from the stone, I’m sure of it, it passed from the stone to my hand. Yes, that’s it, that's just It—a sort of nausea in the hands.

Am I going to take care of my hand? I wonder. I watch the small, monotonous trickle of blood. Now it is coagulating. It's over. My skin looks rusty around the cut. Under the skin, the only thing left is a small sensation exactly like the others, perhaps even more insipid.

Half-past five strikes. I get up, my cold shirt sticks to my flesh. I go out. Why? Well, because I have no reason not to. Even if I stay, even if I crouch silently in a corner, I shall not forget myself. I will be there, my weight on the floor. I am.

I buy a newspaper along my way. Sensational news. Little Lucienne's body has been found! Smell of ink, the paper crumples between my fingers. The criminal has fled. The child was raped. They found her body, the fingers clawing at the mud. I roll the paper into a ball, my fingers clutching at the paper; smell of ink; my God how strongly things exist today. Little Lucienne was raped. Strangled. Her body still exists, her flesh bleeding. She no longer exists. Her hands. She no longer exists. The houses. I walk between the houses, I am between the houses, on the pavement; the pavement under my feet exists, the houses close around me, as the water closes over me, on the paper the shape of a swan. I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don't want to think any more, I am because I think that I don't want to be, I think that I ... because . . . ugh! I flee.

When the patronne goes shopping her cousin replaces her at the bar. His name is Adolphe. I began looking at him as I sat down and I have kept on because I cannot turn my head. He is in shirtsleeves, with purple suspenders; he has rolled the sleeves of his shirt above the elbows. The suspenders can hardly be seen against the blue shirt, they are all obliterated, buried in the blue, but it is false humility; in fact, they will not let themselves be forgotten, they annoy me by their sheep-like stubbornness, as if, starting to become purple, they stopped somewhere along the way without giving up their pretentions. You feel like saying, "All right, become purple and let's hear no more about it." But now, they stay in suspense, stubborn in their defeat. Sometimes the blue which surrounds them slips over and covers them completely: I stay an instant without seeing them. But it is merely a passing wave, soon the blue pales in places and I see the small island of hesitant purple reappear, grow larger, rejoin and reconstitute the suspenders. Cousin Adolphe has no eyes: his swollen, retracted eyelids open only on a little of the whites. He smiles sleepily; from time to time he snorts, yelps and writhes feebly, like a dreaming dog.

His blue cotton shirt stands out joyfully against a chocolate-coloured wall. That too brings on the Nausea. The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it out there in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the cafe, I am the one who is within it. On my right, the warm packet begins to rustle, it waves its pair of arms.

The voice sings: Some of these days You'll miss me, honey.

Someone must have scratched the record at that spot because it makes an odd noise. And there is something that clutches the heart: the melody is absolutely untouched by this tiny coughing of the needle on the record. It is so far—so far behind. I understand that too: the disc is scratched and is wearing out, perhaps the singer is dead; I'm going to leave, I'm going to take my train. But behind the existence which falls from one present to the other, without a past, without a future, behind these sounds which decompose from day to day, peel off and slip towards death, the melody stays the same, young and firm, like a pitiless witness.

---

I would like to hold them back, but I know if I succeeded in stopping one it would remain between my fingers only as a raffish languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even will it. I know few impressions stronger or more harsh.

I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of our time—the time of purple suspenders and broken chair seats; it is made of wide, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years.
