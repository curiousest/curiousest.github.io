## The Queen of Groundhog Day

### Part 1: first encounter

**5 Jan**
*Fiancee*
[15:22] Hey can we schedule some time to talk at some point?
[15:22] I have thought about a lot of things about our relationship
[15:23] I think I should have made a decision long time ago but I have been dragging and dragging
[15:24] The matter is irrelevant with Chad. Because whatever the outcome with him turns out to be, my decision won’t change
[15:24] I want to discuss on the call
[15:24] And we should further discuss in person of course

*Drone*
[16:03] Yup
[16:04] I’m pretty good after work today. 630?

*Fiancee*
[16:30] Kk

*Voice call* [18:30-18:54]

**8 Jan**
*Drone*
[10:43] So about me moving out of the apartment. I think there’s two parts:
1. interconnected finance
2. interconnected living circumstances
Changing both at the same time is too much for me. Can we focus on just one of them?

*Fiancee*
[11:56] Drone
[11:56] But I am redo the financial position for you.
[11:58] you do understand your stability is depends on my sacrifice. I have done a lot of things for your stability for a long time and I don’t want it to do so anymore.
[11:59] I want complete freedom
[11:59] We can negotiate price but that’s what I want
[12:01] So there are only two ways
[12:01] I buy out the apartment from you or you buyout from me

**9 Jan**
*Drone*
[20:01] 👋 hope Thailand is being good to you
[20:01] Yes, very interconnected and that’s suboptimal for you. Sry, lots going on.
[20:02] Would you like to chat tonight or Friday night?

**10 Jan**
*Fiancee*
[00:06] Yeah I think I can do anytime before midnight Thailand time
[00:07] I think it is good to chat multiply time as soon as possible as I really want to get things sorted soon
[00:09] I have been endured too much by myself for a long time
[00:12] Also being chased by my family about marriage and kids. Spent my 20s trying to make a relationship work but that never will. I think I really want to put an end to this as I don’t have much time to waste

*Drone*
[10:51] I’m busy until Friday

*Fiancee*
[10:52] I am sure you would have 30 minutes in the next three days to chat ?

*Drone*
[10:52] More, it’s better to wait until Friday

*Fiancee*
[10:53] I don’t get the point to wait…. If you have concerns
[10:53] Better to address now
[10:53] But sure

*Drone*
[10:53] I don’t want to use it as a negotiating tool or excuse

*Fiancee*
[10:53] If you think other things should take priorities, I have nothing to say

*Drone*
[10:54] Travelling to go to granny’s funeral

*Fiancee*
[10:54] What! What happened
[10:54] Omg, it is okay?
[10:54] Are you okay?

*Drone*
[10:55] Yup
[10:55] Dealing with it

*Fiancee*
[10:55] Okay, deal with that first
[10:55] Let’s talk later

*Drone*
[10:55] Ty

*Fiancee*
[10:57] When did she pass away?
[10:57] I am so sorry to hear that

*Drone*
[10:59] Saturday

*Fiancee*
[11:00] I am so sorry
[11:00] Are you okay?
[11:00] Is it too painful?

*Drone*
[11:01] Yup

*Fiancee*
[11:01] Why you didn’t tell me

---

The deepest suffering you can endure is monotony. Not just because of the daily grind, but also because when you finally break away, the pain of losing your routine will hurt that much worse.

[absurd setting description]
Drone looked at the stained glass windows of the Church. Saints and Jesus and Angels and Mary. A depiction of Mary caught his eye, blue flowing gown lit up. And then an androgynous angel nearby, kinda hot. He looked around for more stained-glass women. They were all depictions of Mary. Not hot. Drone was disappointed.

"This place needs a better variety of women." thought Drone.

The funeral mass stood up for the entrance procession and began to sing Schubert's Ave Maria,

> Ave Maria, gratia plena,  
> Maria, gratia plena,  
> Maria, gratia plena,  
> Ave, Ave, Dominus,  
> Dominus tecum.
> ...

Once the procession finished, the priest spoke,

"O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered, we humbly implore you for your servant Mrs. Lacey, wife of John Lacey, whom you have called to yourself. Through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, grant them eternal rest and bring comfort to us who mourn. Amen."

Drone looked around and saw a booth. It was a booth to commune with various saints. Inside he saw a lady dressed in white. A strange thing to wear to a funeral, since she can't be a priest. She closed the curtain.

[absurd transition]

[encounter Mary]
[better introduction to mary, this is shit, going to meet thing in booth is too stereotypically ]
[have the priest be an LLM?]
[last words with granny embodied in LLM before her data is purged, and then she can meet Peter at the gates to heaven]
Drone went to look for the lady dressed in grey-white. Above the booth read, "Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment."

#### Sees "exit simulation" ad. Meets Mary.

Drugs don't fix reality. Drugs fix the simulation. Less drugs fixes reality. Less drugs.

"Drone, darling, how are you?"
"Uh, don't say my name, that's creepy."
"Dahling, how are you?"
"Mmmh." grunted Drone.

"I won't believe anything you have to say to me. My eyes and ears fail me. Nothing makes sense. How can I believe anything I see or hear? So I must failover to my deeper senses. To what's close to me - my feeling that I can reach out and *feel*. Touch."

The lady in white reached out and he felt nothing.

"We're in a simulation, that's a fact. I can feel it. I want to exit the simulation."

He looked up, and the lady in grey-white met his eyes with understanding. She reached out to hug him. He held his ground, didn't move, and she hugged him around his rigid shoulders. Drone closed his eyes and was hugged. He felt her shake her head and pat his back three times. It wasn't going to happen.

She moved back away from him and made eye contact to get his attention. 
[physical expression of "you already exited the simulation, but you can reverse back into it"]

(afterwards, all the model says is "Dahling, how are you?")

There is no simulation. But you can reverse back out of this reality, to go to where you came from.
You already left the simulation, but you can go back in.

The brood mother doesn't have any children. She instead has many man-childs.
### Part 2: regression to Mary

"Dahling, how are you?"
said Mary, his mother. A common family phrase which roughly translated to "I empathize with you." He didn't have much to say to that, other than giving her a hug, so he opened his arms for one.

[exposition transition, thinking about going back home]

"Dahling, how are you?"
said Mary, his sister. It's strange that unlike men, a line of women who share the same name don't have the same need to differentiate by attaching "junior". So she was just "Mary". And here she was, repeating the common family phrase. He didn't have much to say to it, other than giving a hug, so he opened his arms for one.

She knew without asking that he was hurting a big more than most, with his marital troubles. She stepped back and held one hand cupping his elbow, holding him up slightly, supporting him. She would support him no matter what happened. That's what he needed.


Phone call to grandmother. (women aren't allowed to die, too inconvenient)

### Part 3: "exit simulation"

Today is the day she eats me, finally. I don't have to worry about tomorrow because today I am hers.

I don't have to relive today anymore, she's taking me out of groundhog day.

No darkness, no sleep, no food, no pain.
Go to reality, suffer, want to go back to the womb. Become consumed.

There's no pleasure like the relief of the deepest pain.

And he ceased to feel. And it was optimal.

Mary. The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. Demonic goddess, consumer of ideas.
Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
## The prompt

### Beliefs explored

1. We live outside of Plato's cave, we live outside the simulation. There is no simulation - we already left it. We can go back in - it's warm and cozy inside. Womb, cocoon, and death.
2. Reversal of individualism to one-ness. Description of how you come to identify with different things in the world, by playing the early stages of life/identity in reverse.
3. Detailed communication can happen through touch. Conversation in touch.
4. Within the conception of love, identity and commitment are separable. It is possible to have high-identity, low-commitment love. It is possible to have low-identity, high-commitment love.
5. Time feels like it moves slower/faster for people based on how much novelty they experience relative to their priorities.

#### Part 1: first encounter

Groundhog day description, boring setting.
Drone is away from home, greyscale setting. Struggling with mental health. Sartre "Nausea" descriptions of everyday phenomena, kierkegaard-like thoughts "there's something better out there".
Drone gets text from wife saying to leave the flat by the end of the month [insert]. Asks to slow change, too much changing.
Drone talks to work colleagues, boss. Work is boring.
Goes to grandmother's funeral.
Encounters a trail to Mary.
Follows the trail to Mary.

Introduce Mary in a 1-2 paragraph intense philosophical-visual description. The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. Oozes nausea, that absurd grey substance. Synthesizes nausea, so she can be devoid of it. Spreads the scent out into the world so that her drones follow the trail back to her.
Drone asks her if he can exit the simulation. She responds that there is no simulation, but 
#### Part 2: regression to Mary

Talks to mother. Mother is mary, but speaks different.
Returns to wife. Wife is welcoming and loving, acts as if kicking out of flat never happened. Wife is mary.
Goes to work. Boss is mary. Colleagues become mary.
Comes home, every person is mary.
#### Part 3: exit simulation

Home is mary. Goes outside, shops are mary. Comes back home. Contemplates going out again, but has to traverse non-mary places, so decides not to. Thoughts become mary.

Asks Mary if he can be consumed by her. She obliges.
### Setting

Leading up to the first encounter is grey. Full of nausea.
First encounter is dark, womb-like.
Regression to Mary is accelerating to better mood. Progression to manic.
Exit simulation is climax, on the edge of the womb. Ready to submit wholly.
### Characters

Drone. Male. Thinks of himself as just a number relative to her. She has many drones and he has her. Worships the brood mother. He is self-conscious and doesn't want to be imposing, toeing the line between wanting to merge completely with her, but knowing that would destroy the balance of things.

Mary. The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. Demonic goddess, consumer of ideas.
Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Her demeanour is content and shy. When she exercises her intent, it's precise and intense, but she doesn't often have to - she mostly relies on the drone to facilitate communication. She gets to live the best parts of all the drones she takes care of.

Mary only ever says, "Dahling, how are you?". And after that, only communicates in touch. Drone talks verbally initially when they meet, then transitions to communicating in touch.

Wife.
Mother.
Boss.
Coworkers.

## Notes

Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment.

Committed before creation
Mary, our matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Your unmarried wife, yours before conception.

Mary.
Virgin Mother. Everyone's bride. Unmarried wife.
The virgin of commitment. The uncommitted. Mother uncommitment. Mother commitment. Married to everyone. Committed to everything.
Married to everyone, committed to no one.
Forced into a contradiction, not by her choice. Things happen to her.


**Mary, criticism.**  
The Virgin Mother for a modern age.  
Married to everyone, loyal to none.  
The saint of perpetual availability—always present, never truly there.  
Bound by promises, free of attachment.  
Committed to her image, uncommitted to her reality.  
A choice made by others, carried by her.

**Mary, modern divine.**  
Virgin of the new world.  
Married to everyone, loyal to all.  
The saint of fluidity, always shifting, always adapting.  
Bound by love, free in spirit.  
A symbol of choice, embracing the beauty of contradiction.  
Things happen to her, and she makes meaning of them all.

**Multiplicity as Universality**

- The Virgin Mary is singular in her devotion, but modern Mary is expansive in hers. Her ability to be "married to everyone" reflects an openness to all, an inclusivity that transcends boundaries. She embraces the plurality of relationships, roles, and identities, embodying the richness of connection in a fragmented world.

**Choice in Embracing Contradiction**

- While the Virgin Mary accepts her divine role with faith, modern Mary actively chooses to navigate a world of contradictions. Her ability to balance commitment and independence is not passive but a conscious response to the demands of modernity. She is the saint of managing the impossible, finding strength in complexity.

**Facade as Fluidity**

- Rather than being a weakness, the performative aspect of modern Mary is a kind of grace. She is the saint of reinvention, capable of shifting her focus and identity as needed, without being confined to a single role or expectation. Her surface is not shallow; it’s adaptive, allowing her to meet the world where it is.

**Ambiguity as Freedom**

- Where the Virgin Mary’s certainty comes from submission to a higher power, modern Mary’s ambiguity offers freedom. She is not bound to a fixed path but moves fluidly through life, redefining commitment and loyalty on her own terms. She is a symbol of possibility, where contradictions open doors rather than close them.

**Commitment as Presence**

- Modern Mary’s ability to be committed and uncommitted simultaneously is a reflection of the power of showing up. She might not be tied to a single purpose, but she embodies the virtue of being present for many. In this, she finds meaning not in permanence but in the fleeting moments of connection and care.

The drone spends his time in study halls and libraries, the realm of literature, philosophy, and computation. He sometimes goes for a walk outside on the streets, but it's endless skyscrapers with no people, just constant commuter traffic.

Before you can make something new by “not-ing” something, you need to clearly define the thing being notted.

Open with GroundHog day quotes?

The present conception of love mixes two concepts: identity and survival. They can be separated, and that's where some confusion and conflict about love comes from. Generally, identity and survival wrt you are correlated, but they don't have to be.
Your hand is high-identity, medium commitment. It's part of you, but there are conditions where you would let it die to preserve yourself.
A child is med-identity, high commitment. They are part of you, but also independent of you, and there are few conditions where you would let them die to preserve yourself. While a parent to a child is high-identity, low commitment - you can't imagine yourself without them, but it makes sense that they might make sacrifices to preserve your life.

# Fine-tuning data

## Sartre "Nausea"

I can’t say I feel relieved or satisfied ; just the opposite, I am crushed. Only my goal is reached : I know what I wanted to know ; I have understood all that has happened to me since January. The Nausea has not left me and I don’t believe it will leave me so soon ; but I no longer have to bear it, it is no longer an illness or a passing fit : it is I. 

So I was in the park just now. The roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench. I couldn't remember it was a root any more. The words had vanished and with them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their surface. I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty mass, entirely beastly, which frightened me. Then I had this vision. It left me breathless.

---
There is nothing much to say : I could not pick up the paper, that’s all

I very much like to pick up chestnuts, old rags and especially papers. It is pleasant to me to pick them up, to close my hand on them ; with a little encouragement I would carry them to my mouth the way children do. Anny went into a white rage when I picked up the comers of heavy, sumptuous papers, probably soiled by excrement. In summer or the beginning of autumn, you can find remnants of sun-baked newspapers in gardens, dry and fragile as dead leaves, so yellow you might 18 think they had been washed with picric acid. In winter, some pages are pounded to pulp; crushed, stained, they return to the earth. Others quite new when covered with ice, all white, all throbbing, are like swans about to fly, but the earth has already caught them from below. They twist and tear themselves from the mud, only to be finally flattened out a little further on. It is good to pick up all that. Sometimes I simply feel them, looking at them closely ; other times I tear them to hear their drawn out crackling, or, if they are damp, I light them, not without difficulty ; then I wipe my muddy hands on a wall or tree trunk

So, today, I was watching the riding boots of a cavalry officer who was leaving his barracks. As I followed them with my eyes, I saw a piece of paper lying beside a puddle. I thought the officer was going to crush the paper into the mud with his heel, but no : he straddled paper and puddle in a single step. I went up to it : it was a lined page, undoubtedly torn from a school notebook. The rain had drenched and twisted it, it was covered with blisters and swellings like a burned hand. The red line of the margin was smeared into a pink splotch ; the ink had run in places. The bottom of the page disappeared beneath a crust of mud. I bent down, already rejoicing at the touch of this pulp, fresh and tender, which I should roll in my fingers into greyish balls ... I was

I stayed bent down for a second, I read “ Dictation : TheWhite Owl ”, then I straightened up, empty-handed. I am no longer free, I can no longer do what I will. Objects should not touch because they are not alive. You use them, put them back in place, you live among them : they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it is unbearable. I am afraid of being in contact with them as though they were living beasts. Now I see : I recall better what I felt the other day at the seashore when I held the pebble. It was a sort of sweetish 19 sickness. How unpleasant it was! It came from the stone, I’m sure of it, it passed from the stone to my hand. Yes, that’s it, that's just It—a sort of nausea in the hands.

---

Am I going to take care of my hand? I wonder. I watch the small, monotonous trickle of blood. Now it is coagulating. It's over. My skin looks rusty around the cut. Under the skin, the only thing left is a small sensation exactly like the others, perhaps even more insipid.

Half-past five strikes. I get up, my cold shirt sticks to my flesh. I go out. Why? Well, because I have no reason not to. Even if I stay, even if I crouch silently in a corner, I shall not forget myself. I will be there, my weight on the floor. I am.

I buy a newspaper along my way. Sensational news. Little Lucienne's body has been found! Smell of ink, the paper crumples between my fingers. The criminal has fled. The child was raped. They found her body, the fingers clawing at the mud. I roll the paper into a ball, my fingers clutching at the paper; smell of ink; my God how strongly things exist today. Little Lucienne was raped. Strangled. Her body still exists, her flesh bleeding. She no longer exists. Her hands. She no longer exists. The houses. I walk between the houses, I am between the houses, on the pavement; the pavement under my feet exists, the houses close around me, as the water closes over me, on the paper the shape of a swan. I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don't want to think any more, I am because I think that I don't want to be, I think that I ... because . . . ugh! I flee.

When the patronne goes shopping her cousin replaces her at the bar. His name is Adolphe. I began looking at him as I sat down and I have kept on because I cannot turn my head. He is in shirtsleeves, with purple suspenders; he has rolled the sleeves of his shirt above the elbows. The suspenders can hardly be seen against the blue shirt, they are all obliterated, buried in the blue, but it is false humility; in fact, they will not let themselves be forgotten, they annoy me by their sheep-like stubbornness, as if, starting to become purple, they stopped somewhere along the way without giving up their pretentions. You feel like saying, "All right, become purple and let's hear no more about it." But now, they stay in suspense, stubborn in their defeat. Sometimes the blue which surrounds them slips over and covers them completely: I stay an instant without seeing them. But it is merely a passing wave, soon the blue pales in places and I see the small island of hesitant purple reappear, grow larger, rejoin and reconstitute the suspenders. Cousin Adolphe has no eyes: his swollen, retracted eyelids open only on a little of the whites. He smiles sleepily; from time to time he snorts, yelps and writhes feebly, like a dreaming dog.

His blue cotton shirt stands out joyfully against a chocolate-coloured wall. That too brings on the Nausea. The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it out there in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the cafe, I am the one who is within it. On my right, the warm packet begins to rustle, it waves its pair of arms.

---

The voice sings: Some of these days You'll miss me, honey.

Someone must have scratched the record at that spot because it makes an odd noise. And there is something that clutches the heart: the melody is absolutely untouched by this tiny coughing of the needle on the record. It is so far—so far behind. I understand that too: the disc is scratched and is wearing out, perhaps the singer is dead; I'm going to leave, I'm going to take my train. But behind the existence which falls from one present to the other, without a past, without a future, behind these sounds which decompose from day to day, peel off and slip towards death, the melody stays the same, young and firm, like a pitiless witness.

---

I would like to hold them back, but I know if I succeeded in stopping one it would remain between my fingers only as a raffish languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even will it. I know few impressions stronger or more harsh.

I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of our time—the time of purple suspenders and broken chair seats; it is made of wide, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years.

## Kierkegaard - "Fear and Trembling"

There is a knowledge which would presumptuously introduce into the world of spirit the same law of indifference under which the external world sighs. It counts it enough to think the great–other work is not necessary. But therefore it doesn't get the bread, it perishes of hunger, while everything is transformed into gold. And what does it really know? There were many thousands of Greek contemporaries, and countless numbers in subsequent generations, who knew all the triumphs of Miltiades, but only one19 was made sleepless by them. There were countless generations which knew by rote, word for word, the story of Abraham–how many were made sleepless by it?

Now the story of Abraham has the remarkable property that it is always glorious, however poorly one may understand it; yet here again the proverb applies, that all depends upon whether one is willing to labor and be heavy laden. But they will not labor, and yet they would understand the story. They exalt Abraham–but how? They express the whole thing in perfectly general terms: "The great thing was that he loved God so much that he was willing to sacrifice to Him the best." That is very true, but "the best" is an indefinite expression. In the course of thought, as the tongue wags on, Isaac and "the best" are confidently identified, and he who meditates can very well smoke his pipe during the meditation, and the auditor can very well stretch out his legs in comfort. In case that rich young man whom Christ encountered on the road had sold all his goods and given to the poor, we should extol him, as we do all that is great, though without labor we would not understand him–and yet he would not have become an Abraham, in spite of the fact that he offered his best. What they leave out of Abraham's history is dread;20 for to money I have no ethical obligation, but to the son the father has the highest and most sacred obligation. Dread, however, is a perilous thing for effeminate natures, hence they forget it, and in spite of that they want to talk about Abraham. So they talk–in the course of the oration they use indifferently the two terms, Isaac and "the best." All goes famously. However, if it chanced that among the auditors there was one who suffered from insomnia–then the most dreadful, the profoundest tragic and comic misunderstanding lies very close. He went home, he would do as Abraham did, for the son is indeed "the best."

[start]

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all– what then would life be but despair? If such were the case, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage in the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw–how empty then and comfortless life would be!

---

[start]

No, not one shall be forgotten who was great in the world. But each was great in his own way, and each in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. For he who loved himself became great by himself, and he who loved other men became great by his selfless devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each became great in proportion to his expectation. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal, but he who expected the impossible became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each was great in proportion to the greatness of that with which he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by overcoming the world, and he who strove with himself became great by overcoming himself, but he who strove with God became greater than all. So there was strife in the world, man against man, one against a thousand, but he who strove with God was greater than all. So there was strife upon earth: there was one who overcame all by his power, and there was one who overcame God by his impotence. There was one who relied upon himself and gained all, there was one who secure in his strength sacrificed all, but he who believed God was greater than all. There was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of the love which is hatred of oneself.

---

If such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on "The Good and the Conscience," he characterizes man merely as the particular and regards this character as "a moral form of evil" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, Hegel is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.

For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal– yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world … because it has always existed.

---

And yet they extol Abraham. He who is to deliver the discourse can very well sleep till a quarter of an hour before he has to preach, the auditor can well take a nap during the discourse, for all goes smoothly, without the least trouble from any quarter. If there was a man present who suffered from insomnia, perhaps he then went home and sat in a corner and thought: "It's an affair of a moment, this whole thing; if only you wait a minute, you see the ram, and the trial is over." If the orator were to encounter him in this condition, he would, I think, confront him with all his dignity and say, "Wretched man, that thou couldst let thy soul sink into such foolishness! No miracle occurs. The whole of life is a trial." In proportion as the orator proceeds with his outpouring, he would get more and more excited, would become more and more delighted with himself, and whereas he had noticed no congestion of the blood while he talked about Abraham, he now felt how the vein swelled in his forehead. Perhaps he would have lost his breath as well as his tongue if the sinner had answered calmly and with dignity, "But it was about this you preached last Sunday."

Let us then either consign Abraham to oblivion, or let us learn to be dismayed by the tremendous paradox which constitutes the significance of Abraham's life, that we may understand that our age, like every age, can be joyful if it has faith. In case Abraham is not a nullity, a phantom, a show one employs for a pastime, then the fault can never consist in the fact that the sinner wants to do likewise, but the point is to see how great a thing it was that Abraham did, in order that man may judge for himself whether he has the call and the courage to be subjected to such a test. The comic contradiction in the behavior of the orator is that he reduced Abraham to an insignificance, and yet would admonish the other to behave in the same way.

Should not one dare then to talk about Abraham? I think one should. If I were to talk about him, I would first depict the pain of his trial. To that end I would like a leech suck all the dread and distress and torture out of a father's sufferings, so that I might describe what Abraham suffered, whereas all the while he nevertheless believed. I would remind the audience that the journey lasted three days and a good part of the fourth, yea, that these three and a half days were infinitely longer than the few thousand years which separate me from Abraham. Then I would remind them that, in my opinion, every man dare still turn around ere he begins such an undertaking, and every instant he can repentantly turn back. If one does this, I fear no danger, nor am I afraid of awakening in people an inclination to be tried like Abraham. But if one would dispose of a cheap edition of Abraham, and yet admonish everyone to do likewise, then it is ludicrous.

It is now my intention to draw out from the story of Abraham the dialectical consequences inherent in it, expressing them in the form of problemata, in order to see what a tremendous paradox faith is, a paradox which is capable of transforming a murder into a holy act well-pleasing to God, a paradox which gives Isaac back to Abraham, which no thought can master, because faith begins precisely there where thinking leaves off.

The slaves of paltriness, the frogs in life's swamp, will naturally cry out, "Such a love is foolishness. The rich brewer's widow is a match fully as good and respectable." Let them croak in the swamp undisturbed.

It is not so with the knight of infinite resignation, he does not give up his love, not for all the glory of the world. He is no fool. First he makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and too proud to squander the least thing upon an inebriation. He is not cowardly, he is not afraid of letting love creep into his most secret, his most hidden thoughts, to let it twine in innumerable coils about every ligament of his consciousness–if the love becomes an unhappy love, he will never be able to tear himself loose from it. He feels a blissful rapture in letting love tingle through every nerve, and yet his soul is as solemn as that of the man who has drained the poisoned goblet and feels how the juice permeates every drop of blood–for this instant is life and death.30 So when he has thus sucked into himself the whole of love and absorbed himself in it, he does not lack courage to make trial of everything and to venture everything. He surveys the situation of his life, he convokes the swift thoughts, which like tame doves obey his every bidding, he waves his wand over them, and they dart off in all directions. But when they all return, all as messengers of sorrow, and declare to him that it is an impossibility, then he becomes quiet, he dismisses them, he remains alone, and then he performs the movements. If what I am saying is to have any significance, it is requisite that the movement come about normally.*

## Orson Scott Card "Speaker for the Dead"

"Maybe this will be the place," he murmured. The cocoon felt cool, almost cold, even through the towels it was wrapped in. 

 (It is the place.)

It was unnerving to have her so certain of it. There was no hint of pleading or impatience or any of the other feelings she had given him, desiring to emerge. Just absolute certainty.

"I wish we could decide just like that," he said. "It might be the place, but it all depends on whether the piggies can cope with having you here."

(The question is whether they can cope with you humans without us.)

"It takes time. Give me a few months here."

(Take all the time you need. We're in no hurry now.)

"Who is it that you've found? I thought you told me that you couldn't communicate with anybody but me."

---

"Maybe I loved the young girl, but this woman is nasty and selfish. Look what she let happen to her children."

"This is the Speaker for the Dead? Judging someone by appearances?"
"Maybe I've fallen in love with Grego."
"You've always been a sucker for people who pee on you."
"And Quara. All of them-- even Miro, I like the boy."
"And they love you, Ender."
He laughed. "People always think they love me, until I Speak. Novinha's more perceptive than most-- she already hates me before I tell the truth."
"You're as blind about yourself as anyone else, Speaker," said Jane. "Promise me that when you die, you'll let me Speak your death. Have I got things to say."
"Keep them to yourself," said Ender wearily. "You're even worse at this business than I am."
He began his list of questions to be resolved.

---

She knew several things, then. She knew that the piggies were ramen, not varelse. She also knew that Ender ran a serious risk of dying in precisely the same way Pipo and Libo had died. 

Without conferring with Ender, she made decisions about her own course of action. She would continue to monitor Ender, and would make sure to intervene and warn him if he came too near to death. In the meantime, though, she had work to do. As she saw it, the chief problem Ender faced was not the piggies-- she knew that he'd know them soon as well as he understood every other human or raman. His ability at intuitive empathy was entirely reliable. The chief problem was Bishop Peregrino and the Catholic hierarchy, and their unshakable resistance to the Speaker for the Dead. If Ender was to accomplish anything for the piggies, he would have to have the cooperation, not the enmity, of the Church in Lusitania.

And nothing spawned cooperation better than a common enemy. 

It would certainly have been discovered eventually. The observation satellites that orbited Lusitania were feeding vast streams of data into the ansible reports that went to all the xenologers and xenobiologists in the Hundred Worlds. Amid that data was a subtle change in the grasslands to the northwest of the forest that abutted the town of Milagre. The native grass was steadily being replaced by a different plant. It was in an area where no human ever went, and piggies had also never gone there-- at least during the first thirty-odd years since the satellites had been in place.

---

Miro did not know what to make of the Speaker for the Dead. Somehow he had always imagined a Speaker to be very much like a priest-- or rather, like a priest was supposed to be. Quiet, contemplative, withdrawn from the world, carefully leaving action and decision to others. Miro had expected him to be wise.

He had not expected him to be so intrusive, so dangerous. Yes, he was wise, all right, he kept seeing past pretense, kept saying or doing outrageous things that were, when you thought about it, exactly right. It was as if he were so familiar with the human mind that he could see, right on your face, the desires so deep, the truths so well-disguised that you didn't even know yourself that you had them in you.

---

Human leaned closer, then let his body become rigid in excitement, in anticipation. "O Speaker!" he said, and his voice was powerful with the importance of his words. "Will you add our story to the Hive Queen and the Hegemon?"

"I don't know your story," said the Speaker.
"Ask us! Ask us anything!"
"How can I tell your story? I only tell the stories of the dead."

"We are dead!" shouted Human. Miro had never seen him so agitated. "We are being murdered every day. Humans are filling up all the worlds. The ships travel through the black of night from star to star to star, filling up every empty place. Here we are, on our one little world, watching the sky fill up with humans. The humans build their stupid fence to keep us out, but that is nothing. The sky is our fence!" Human leapt upward-- startlingly high, for his legs were powerful. "Look how the fence throws me back down to the ground!"

He ran at the nearest tree, bounded up the trunk, higher than Miro had ever seen him climb; he shinnied out on a limb and threw himself upward into the air. He hung there for an agonizing moment at the apex of his leap; then gravity flung him downward onto the hard ground.

---

"His third name was C o. Dog." 

Ah, yes, thought the Lusos. This is what we've heard about Speakers for the Dead. They have no respect for the dead, no sense of decorum.
"That was the name you used for him when you heard that his wife, Novinha, had another black eye, walked with a limp, had stitches in her lip. He was an animal to do that to her."
How dare he say that? The man's dead! But under their anger the Lusos were uncomfortable for an entirely different reason. Almost all of them remembered saying or hearing exactly those words. The Speaker's indiscretion was in repeating in public the words that they had used about Marc o when he was alive.

"Not that any of you liked Novinha. Not that cold woman who never gave any of you good morning. But she was smaller than he was, and she was the mother of his children, and when he beat her he deserved the name of C o."
They were embarrassed; they muttered to each other. Those sitting in the grass near Novinha glanced at her and glanced away, eager to see how she was reacting, painfully aware of the fact that the Speaker was right, that they didn't like her, that they at once feared and pitied her.

---

Then the Speaker stood before the microphone and waited for them to be still. He was fairly tall, youngish still, but his white skin made him look sickly compared to the thousand shades of brown of the Lusos. Ghostly. They fell silent, and he began to Speak.

"He was known by three names. The official records have the first one: Marcos Maria Ribeira. And his official data. Born 1929. Died 1970. Worked in the steel foundry. Perfect safety record. Never arrested. A wife, six children. A model citizen, because he never did anything bad enough to go on the public record.

"Many who were listening felt a vague disquiet. They had expected oration. Instead the Speaker's voice was nothing remarkable. And his words had none of the formality of religious speech. Plain, simple, almost conversational. Only a few of them noticed that its very simplicity made his voice, his speech utterly believable. He wasn't telling the Truth, with trumpets; he was telling the truth, the story that you wouldn't think to doubt because it's taken for granted. Bishop Peregrino was one who noticed, and it made him uneasy. This Speaker would be a formidable enemy, one who could not be blasted down with fire from before the altar.

"The second name he had was Marc o. Big Marcos. Because he was a giant of a man. Reached his adult size early in his life. How old was he when he reached two meters? Eleven? Definitely by the time he was twelve. His size and strength made him valuable in the foundry, where the lots of steel are so small that much of the work is controlled directly by hand, and strength matters. People's lives depended on Marc o's strength."

In the praqa the men from the foundry nodded. They had all bragged to each other that they'd never talk to the framling atheist. Obviously one of them had, but now it felt good that the Speaker got it right, that he understood what they remembered of Marc o. Every one of them wished that he had been the one to tell about Marc o to the Speaker. They did not guess that the Speaker had not even tried to talk to them.

---

But Miro refused to sleep. He continued spelling out his message as the terminal scanned. Together the three of them worked out what he was trying to get them to tell the Speaker. And they understood that he wanted them to go now, before the negotiations ended.

So Novinha left Dom Crist o and Dona Crist to watch over the house and the little children. On the way out of the house she stopped beside her oldest son. The exertion had worn him out; his eyes were closed and his breathing was regular. She touched his hand, held it, squeezed it; he couldn't feel her touch, she knew, but then it was herself she was comforting, not him.
He opened his eyes. And, ever so gently, she felt his fingers tighten on hers. "I felt it," she whispered to him. "You'll be all right."

## Groundhog Day

PHIL
(nervous, sweat ing)
I've got to talk to you. I think
I'm losing my mind.

RITA
I know you're losing it. What
are you doing over here? The
camera's over there.
PHIL
Slap me, Rita.
RITA
What is this?
PHIL
(insistent)
Just slap me— hard.
She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.

PHIL
I said hard!
RITA
I can't!
PHIL
Do it!
Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.
PHIL
(his cheek smarting)
Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

RITA
Are you drunk?
PHIL
No, drunk is more fun. Can I be
serious with you for a minute?
RITA
I don't know. Can you?
PHIL
Yes. I'm being serious. I'm
having a problem— no, I may be
having a problem.
RITA
What are you trying to say?
PHIL
I'm trying to say that if I was
having a problem, just
hypothetically, I'd like to know
that you're someone I could count
on in a crisis.
RITA
(worried)
What did you do last night?

---

Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
sink.

Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the mirror with his sledgehammer.

Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls, madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the room with it. As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open, then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of feathers. Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.

We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil sleeping on the bed.

He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy as the day he checked in. He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved. The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word right along with them, shocked into a state of complete wonderment.

---

He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.

PHIL
How was that?
RITA
(pleased)
It was good. A little smarmy for
my taste, but I guess that's what
sells.
PHIL
Could I talk to you about a
matter that is not work related?
RITA
You never talk about work.
PHIL
Do you know what I did last
night?
RITA
Do I want to know?

---

RITA
Okay, so tell me. How'd you know
where to put the camera?

PHIL
Because I've done it before.
RITA
I know, but the groundhog doesn't
do exactly the same thing every
year, does he?
PHIL
I'm not talking about last year.
I'm talking about today. I lived
it before.
RITA
You're having deja vu?
PHIL
Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts
but I keep reliving the same day
over and over— Groundhog Day—
today. This is the third time.

RITA
(completely skeptical)
Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the
punchline.
PHIL
No, really. It's like today never happened. I shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They'd grow back. Just like a starfish. I probably don't even have to floss?
RITA
I'm wracking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this.
PHIL
'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm asking for your help.
Rita looks at him for a long moment.
RITA
Okay, I'll bite. What do you
want me to do?
PHIL
The truth? I'd like you to spend the next 24 hours with me and don't leave my side for a second.

---

Phil is lying on a couch. His head is completely shaved.

PHIL
Yeah, but you're still a psychologist. You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing.
PSYCHOLOGIST
Sort of, I guess. Abnormal Psychology.
PHIL
So based on that what would you say?
PSYCHOLOGIST
(hesitant)
I 'd say that maybe you're — I don't know* — a little delusional.
PHIL
You're saying this thing is not really happening to me?
PSYCHOLOGIST
Uh-huh.

PHIL
Then how do I know this conversation is really happening?
PSYCHOLOGIST
I guess you don't.
PHIL
Then forget about me paying you.
A discreet little alarm sounds.
PSYCHOLOGIST
(relieved)
I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Connors.
PHIL
Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy?
PSYCHOLOGIST
(humoring him)
Not necessarily. If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible. How's tomorrow for you?

---

PHIL
No, they're gone. Rita, if you only had one day to live, what would you do with it?

She switches off the videotape and steps out of the van.
RITA
I don't know, Phil. What are you dying of?
PHIL
No, I mean like what if the entire world was about to explode?
RITA
I'd just want to know where to put the camera. What are you looking for, Phil— a date for the weekend?
She starts walking toward the center of town. Phil sticks right with her.
PHIL
No, I just want to know you better. What do you like, what do you want, what do you think about, what kind of men are you interested in, what do you do for fun?

RITA
(she stops)
Is this real or are you just going to make me feel like a fool?
PHIL
I'm just trying to talk to you like a normal person. Isn't this how normal people talk?
RITA
Close.
PHIL
Okay, so talk to me. C'mon, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
