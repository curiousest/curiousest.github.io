## Frontier Models: Printer

Upstart scientist discovers model that creates universal laws.
Ends up in self-destruction, similar to time travel paradoxes. Except the universal laws persist and no one remembers the scientist. A strange loop - like a magnet where current flows in one direction to generate activity in a perpendicular direction.

Incorporate the story of Satoshi, and the universal side-effect is the creation of crypto? ("the creators of the universe are not remembered")

Taking advantage of the recall recognition. Compression decompression pushing forward intelligence like an accordion.

Quantum entanglement suggesting that universal laws are part created part discovered. Story of physicist discovering generative equations that join physics.
