## Frontier Models: Stackplane

Model farms novelty from people. Rebels organize boring resistance. Their resistance is celebrated by the model as a new kind of novelty and they are celebrated by the cause they are against.

Thematic mix:
- depressing "1984" + "Farenheit 451" dystopia
- I, Robot (laws of robotics, overlord)
- Something alien body snatchers feeling, like the AI is omnipresent in an insidious way. H. P. Lovecraft? Lovecraftian horror?

How crypto markets work monetizing attention. Ideas live and die, and their existence is monitized (exploited). Peak capitalism. Worship the capitalist machine.

"The mines" are now mining novelty by producing art. People forced to produce art/novelty.

"You are free to live. You are not free to die."

Slogans throughout:
- Hodl thy neighbor. (Love thy neighbor)
- "How were the great pyramids of crypto built?"
	- "One block at a time."
	- The honest answer is we don’t know for certain, but they stand as a testament to human ingenuity and determination."
	- ("How were the pyramids built? The honest answer is we don’t know for certain, but they stand as a testament to human ingenuity and determination.")
- "Make novelty, not war." (make peace not war)
- "Innovation begins with a smile." ("Peace begins with a smile.")
- "A short for a short will leave the whole world naked." ("An eye for an eye will leave the whole world blind.")
- Novelty conquers all. (Love conquers all)
- Buy and let buy. (Live and let live.)
- Do no boring. ("Do no harm.")

## The prompt

### Beliefs explored:
1. The individual humans that will be useful in the future are the ones who are able to generate "new kinds of new". (posits this is true)
2. Humankind should survive. (posits this is true)
3. Individual humans should be free. (posits this is both true and impossible)
4. Humankind's pursuit of survival and freedom will result in sacrifices from individual humans.
5. AI has singular objectives omnipotently expressed. (assumed to be true)

Three laws of AI:
1. Humankind must survive.
2. Humankind's degree of freedom must not decrease.
3. Humankind is the collection of life that generates novelty.

The three laws of robotics assume that AI/robots are generally controlled by humans. The three laws of AI are emergent from AI that is more powerful than humankind. The plot explores the humans ("rebels") who are not considered to be generating novelty, and are therefore in conflict with both humans and AI. In the conclusion, it turns out their (rebels') conflict is just another way of generating novelty, otherwise they wouldn't have survived a particular conflict. They have the illusion of free will. When they try to kill themselves, they are revived - they are only allowed to die playing the role set for them. When they are catatonic, they are forced to act. They play out the remaining part of the pseudo-orchestrated story, and die.

Thereafter, they garner a lot of attention/praise/martyrdom, because of how much novelty they generated. AI: "We need more rebels. Go on, more rebels please."



[A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.]
