## Frontier Models: Storysteal

"The best dream is the one stolen from someones else's heart."

(The best chip is the ones stolen from someone else's plate.)

Model that steals data during people's dreams. (dreams are where something data-important happens)

Innovator/artist protecting a story/idea/tech they're trying to produce IRL. Innovator/artist encounters storysteal model while lucid dreaming. Turns into combatitive encounters in lucid dreams where the character has to avoiding the topic in their dreams, so the model can't steal it.

Twist ending: kierkegaard-like, eros, "thing defined by not-it". The model gets a higher-fidelity version of the idea **because** the artist avoided it so deeply.

Themes of loki / trickster / etc. Inspect/explore why trickster x dreams are historically intertwined. The meaning behind it.

Dream events recollected backwards/written backwards, like how you remember a dream.
Character practices behaviours outside of dream in forward-looking narrative, to plan how to behave inside the dream where planning falls apart/is not so possible.
