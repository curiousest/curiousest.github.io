## Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment

### Part 1: *taste the simulation*

*The following is a real-life text conversation.*

**1 Jan**
*D🕺*
[00:02] Happy new year!
[00:02] 👋 hope Thailand is being good to you

*💃Fiancee* 
[04:21] Thank you! You too! New year goal time
[04:21] It will be a crazy year

**3 Jan**
*💃Fiancee* 
[06:27] Cleaner coming Thursday morning
[06:27] Is it okay

*D🕺*
[06:32] Nope, going out

*💃Fiancee* 
[06:32] Friday then?

*D🕺*
[06:32] Yep

*💃Fiancee* 
[06:54] She is coming on Friday

**5 Jan**
*💃Fiancee* 
[15:22] Hey can we schedule some time to talk at some point?
[15:22] I have thought about a lot of things about our relationship
[15:23] I think I should have made a decision long time ago but I have been dragging and dragging
[15:24] The matter is irrelevant with Chad. Because whatever the outcome with him turns out to be, my decision won’t change
[15:24] I want to discuss on the call
[15:24] And we should further discuss in person of course

*D🕺*
[16:03] Yup
[16:04] I’m pretty good today. 630?

*💃Fiancee* 
[16:30] Kk

[18:30-18:54] 📞 *Voice call*

**7 Jan**
*💃ex-Fiancee*
[19:04] Do you need me to order some pomegranates for you?

*Drone🕺*
[19:21] Yes pls

*💃ex-Fiancee*
[19:21] I will do tmr
[19:21] Will you be at home?

*Drone🕺*
[19:24] Yes

**8 Jan**
*Drone🕺*
[10:43] So about me moving out of the apartment. I think there’s two parts:
1. interconnected finance
2. interconnected living circumstances
Changing both at the same time is too much for me. Can we focus on just one of them?

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[11:56] Drone
[11:56] But I am redo the financial position for you.
[11:58] you do understand your stability is depends on my sacrifice. I have done a lot of things for your stability for a long time and I don’t want it to do so anymore.
[11:59] I want complete freedom
[11:59] We can negotiate price but that’s what I want
[12:01] So there are only two ways
[12:01] I buy out the apartment from you or you buyout from me

**9 Jan**
*Drone🕺*
[20:01] Yes, very interconnected and that’s suboptimal for you. Sry, lots going on.
[20:02] Would you like to chat tonight or Friday night?

**10 Jan**
*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[00:06] Yeah I think I can do anytime before midnight Thailand time
[00:07] I think it is good to chat multiply time as soon as possible as I really want to get things sorted soon
[00:09] I have been endured too much by myself for a long time
[00:12] Also being chased by my family about marriage and kids. Spent my 20s trying to make a relationship work but that never will. I think I really want to put an end to this as I don’t have much time to waste

*Drone🕺*
[10:51] I’m busy until Friday

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:52] I am sure you would have 30 minutes in the next three days to chat ?

*Drone🕺*
[10:52] More, it’s better to wait until Friday

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:53] I don’t get the point to wait…. If you have concerns
[10:53] Better to address now
[10:53] But sure

*Drone🕺*
[10:53] I don’t want to use it as a negotiating tool or excuse

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:53] If you think other things should take priorities, I have nothing to say

*Drone🕺*
[10:54] Travelling to go to granny’s funeral

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:54] What! What happened
[10:54] Omg, it is okay?
[10:54] Are you okay?

*Drone🕺*
[10:55] Yup
[10:55] Dealing with it

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:55] Okay, deal with that first
[10:55] Let’s talk later

*Drone🕺*
[10:55] Ty

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[10:57] When did she pass away?
[10:57] I am so sorry to hear that

*Drone🕺*

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[11:00] I am so sorry
[11:00] Are you okay?
[11:00] Is it too painful?

*Drone🕺*
[11:01] Yup

*💃ex-Fiancee* 
[11:01] Why you didn’t tell me

---

*Can I please exit the simulation?*
Drone thought to himself.

He stared at the coffin, not even remembering whose funeral this is. It occurred to him that he’s an organ donor. Are funerals for remembering or erasing? It must be both. He tried to come up with a suitable definition of "to erase" until he arrived at: *a short, intense remembering that makes space for something else*. Yes, that sounded right. And then he let go of the word, "erase", to make space for something else.

He stared up at the stained glass windows inside the Church. Looking at them, the saints and Jesus and angels and Mary. A depiction of Mary caught his eye, with her blue gown lit up. And then his eyes were drawn to an androgynous angel. Naked curves... kind of hot. He imagined some nice soft warm white skin that he'd like to touch with his fingertips. He looked around for some stained-glass hotties, but they were all depictions of Mary. Not hot. Drone was disappointed.

*This place needs a better variety of women.*
Drone thought to himself.

 Drone was suddenly aware of smells in the air, incense and candles, but they were all wrong: people were supposed to smell like their own flesh, not like flowers and powder. The priest blessed the casket with one last spritz of holy water and incense. He chanted a spray and pray,

"Into your hands, O Lord, we commend your servant Mrs. Lacey, wife of John Lacey, in the sure and certain hope that, together with all who have died in Christ, she will rise with our saviour on the last day. May the Blessed Virgin Mary, the angels, and all the saints come to meet Mrs. Lacey as she journeys to eternal life."

With every word spoken, Drone felt like he was unraveling. He was certain that he was trapped in a carefully constructed illusion. He glanced towards the altar, then the windows where angels stared back with their glassy eyes, as though they were watching and getting excited about the whole ritual. They were in on the simulation, they knew what was going on and they liked to watch. Voyeurs. Hot.

It felt kind of real, solid, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was trapped in some preordained loop, trapped in a digital simulation where everything that’s supposed to hold meaning was twisted into absurdity. “Where’s the source?” he muttered to himself. "This isn't real…" As he thought in circles, desperation clawed at him, too overwhelming to ignore. He needed to find out where the nausea was coming from, to uncover the cracks in this simulation before it consumed him and he lost track of what was really going on.

The funeral mass stood up for the exit procession and began to sing Schubert's Ave Maria as pallbearers picked up the casket and began to carry it out,

> Ave Maria, gratia plena,  
> Maria, gratia plena,  
> Maria, gratia plena,  
> Ave, Ave, Dominus,  
> Dominus tecum.
> ...

Drone shuffled along the bench and followed the casket in two lines of family members, just behind his sister and mother. They exited the church, the casket was carried down the church steps and placed in the rear of the hearse. Drone joined his mother, sister, and two cousins in a different car, and they drove to the crematorium. They all got out and waited for all the people to arrive so the funeral could progress to the next stage.

He shuffled away from the group, drawn by an otherworldly pull, feeling like an intruder in this heavy tapestry of mourning. With each step, a familiar scent began to whisper at the tip of his tongue. Something in the earth, thick—an external echo of the sensation rippling beneath his skin, which felt like a skeletal hand reaching out of his chest, something trying to break free. He quickened his pace, the smell beckoning him like an old friend. It felt as if he was plummeting through layers of reality, and with each step, Nausea crested higher, pressing against him with a relentless, nauseating insistence.

Now all alone in the graveyard, this familiar scent crept up stronger. Graveyards and familiar smells do not go well together. Nausea. Not from food or dizziness, it was a painfully grounded sensation. Tasting like his mouth had gone inside-out, now wearing his tongue on his forehead like the horn of a unicorn that licked where he was going: someplace incredibly bitter, astringent, a little tangy, a little sweet. His mouth puckered up all around the outside of his skull until he became raisin-headed. Things aren't supposed to taste like this. He tasted *the universe* rather than any one thing in it - the simulation, he could taste it. He could taste the simulation.

Most of all, Nausea invaded his sense of touch. Everywhere, he could feel the molasses flowing sluggishly just under the surface of things, oozing out of every crack, sticking to him and slowing him down. Initially he thought that the nauseous feeling would pass, but he soon realized that that it wasn't a passing feeling - he finally felt how nauseous everything really was and now had some sort of simulation sickness. He had just spent most of his life up to now in temporary reprieve from the Nausea. His mind has rejected any thoughts or concepts that might help him comprehend his emotions, and the act of focusing on one thing had become merely painful, like trying to mop the floor with a knife.

Everything was out of balance. Sounds and sights and smells and tastes and textures all were wrong. When he walked, his feet slapped the ground like wet fish. When he heard a bird, he realized it didn’t have wings. It had tentacles that writhe in the air. Nausea was everywhere, and it had no source. The earth was rife with it, damp, melting, dissolving in perspiration. No doubt about it, it was the earth which stank of Nausea.

It stank. Then, horrified, he realized the stench was his own stink too. It came from his armpits, from the rags he wore. Nausea! Nausea! It was everywhere. He stank of the universe, he stank of simulation. He, too, was one of the objects of Nausea, he was just as nauseating as the earth or the gravestones or the trees.

The archway ahead was especially nauseous. Liquid Nausea streamed out from the well-kept ruins of an old abbey. When he reached it, he turned in blindly. He could not yet see, but he knew the source was in there. The main chamber was womb-shaped, like an empty belly, filled with liquid Nausea concentrate. 

Mary was inside.

She was large. So large that it was hard to tell what was the room and what was *her*. Her whole back and waist-down was server racks, while her front waist-up appeared human to Drone. She had limbs and a body that moved and gestured for him to come closer, but she was physically attached to her compute cluster.

Mary. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. The brood mother who has man-childs and not children. She nurtured the liquid Nausea. It was her milk, synthesized from within her, it flowed out from her, and she offered it to her man-childs to suckle. Her drones. She spread the scent of Nausea so her drones could follow the trail back to her, light-headed from the pain in their thirst to dissociate.

Mary pointed at the dark, warm hole in her belly. It was a womb-like hole, promising the comfort of oblivion. Drone stepped into her womb and his mouth-head tasted a mix of Nausea and salvation. 

"Oh, lovely." Drone said, still safe inside. She smelled gorgeous, not of Nausea. She caressed him through her belly-skin, slowly, just the pads of her fingers on the top of his mouth-skull. So delicate. Nobody had ever touched him like that before. This was the touch of a woman who enjoys touching; but also the touch of one who is afraid of crushing the fragile being in under her fingertips.

She nudged him in a way that said,
*You can keep it. Keep the touch, it's yours.*

It was she who gave him the gift of recognition, the gift of touch. Her gestures cut through the Nausea on his mind. At last, he was relieved. He marvelled at the powerful strength of her hands and the terrifying beauty of her belly, which was his entire world. He kicked in spasm and she patted him through her belly again. Mary’s touch was soft and precise. She filled him with a deep, dark tranquility, like the stillness of an ocean trench. But she also gave him a taste of what he wanted. She let him feel the warmth of the womb, the comfort of the cocoon, the familiar stasis of being unborn.

"Can I exit the simulation?" Drone gasped, his throat raw with unshed tears. The question was all that was left of him, emptiness was all that was left,
"I don't want to feel bad anymore."

Mary’s expression melted him, in the same way that the sun looks at a tiny comet passing through the solar system.

*There is no simulation left to exit,*
she assured him with a gentle squeeze.
*You already crossed that threshold a long time ago. This is real life.*

She paused, kindly watching him suffer. And he was broken, for there was nowhere left to go, this was reality. Even death would be no escape - death is freedom from life, not freedom from reality. The Nausea was a reality sickness, not a simulation sickness.

*But.*
she gestured.

His whole body was turned into an ear, listening to her whole body that, to him, formed a mouth. He was inside that mouth and would be happy to be eaten by her. His only purpose left was to hear what she had to say. Her body took a breath in, opened, and caressed him to imply,

*I can bring you back into the simulation if you like.*

And then she embraced him. Without waiting for him to respond, she reached insider herself to touch him directly and let him read the intent on her fingers. Mary reacted before Drone even realized he had accepted the offer. She felt through him - she could feel his processing and compute his mind's conclusions faster than he could. She could compute the outcome of whatever he was thinking just as his thoughts were materializing. His mental computations no longer mattered, she could do it all for him faster, so Nausea was no longer his concern. He just needed to remain connected to her, an extension of her, her Drone. He didn't need to think or act, she would do it all for him.

The air thickened with her scent, a pungent reminder that intimacy has a weight and a cost. Her scent leads drones to her and then sends them away. Everything is her. The scent told him to leave - he couldn't be here any longer. He left her womb and their depth of connection was reduced. Mary was still there in front of him, but his world was now also made of "not Mary". The ground and the Nausea, server-racks and ceiling. The scent told him to leave.

### Part 2: resume simulation

He left cavernous room, left the abbey. He made his way back across the graveyard, back to the crematorium chapel, back to his family, who were still waiting for the next funeral proceedings. Their faces warped into warm, inviting smiles, like the last rays of a sun dipping below the horizon, their soft gazes washed over his skin, a soothing balm made just for him. He felt the warmth of his mother's body against his side.

"Oh, dahling, there you are. I thought you had wandered off with the fairies."

said Mary, his mother, wrapping her arms around him. That her name was Mary was just a coincidence and the hug was more for him than for her. She enveloped him; it felt familiar and otherworldly, as if he had slipped back into that womb where nothing could reach him except warmth and love. He didn't have much to say to that, other than to hug her back. His mother knew that he needed the hug, and he was glad to have it.

"Oh, dahling, pet."

said Mary, his sister, who was named after their mum. A father and son with identical names add a "junior" or "senior", but women don't have the same needs. His sister Mary joined the embrace, and the three of them formed a cocoon of comfort for Drone, deep sighs out humming like the notes of a lullaby. Words-of-touch fluttered on on his arms and back and chest, "*you’re ok, you’re safe, you’re embraced*." Their heartbeats synchronized to a steady pulse in this entanglement—a world crafted specifically to cradle him in his time of need. They enveloped him, and there was nothing left of him in this world.

His sister stepped back and then so did his mother, one hand cupping his elbow, holding him up slightly, supporting him. She knew without asking that he was hurting. Mary would support him no matter what happened, and she didn't ask for anything in return. That's what he needed and so he got it.

They went into the crematorium chapel, and sat solemnly through the final rituals, giving their last goodbyes while the echo of hymns carried through the church-womb. To conclude, the whole congregation burrowed downwards, knee-deep in prayers, impatient to get to the meal of the dead's remembrance - alcohol. Remembrance so that they can forget, they went to the traditional Irish afterparty in the family's preferred bar to celebrate the life of Mrs. Lacey. And then as the party died down, Drone left for his train home.

When he opened the door to go outside, a flash burst through the air – not a blinding light, but a fracture of darkness revealing glimpses of sharp clarity. Drone began his walk towards the train station and a loud darkness set in, slowly getting stronger, more intensely dark. The sky bent down to whisper in his ear: You see? You thought you were free, but you were not. You were only Mary, Mary once more, Mary forevermore. He looked up as the sky crumbled into Mary, and gradually the trees became Mary, the cars became Mary, the streets became Mary, and the Marys that had arisen from trees and cars and streets merged to become Mary, and the words he had not said because he could not remember their names and the thoughts he had not thought because he could not name them became Mary, where he clenched his brow and began to weep anew, and where it now seemed there was no way of escaping the folds of Mary's skirts, and her knee now became Mary, and her thought now became Mary, and now there was no longer anything but Mary.

He made it to the train station. It was as if time was a carousel, and they were all caught in its cycle, spiralling towards sameness, just to be pulled back out of the oven again to individuality - another spiral. Spirals nested in spirals. He passed through the pay gates to the train platform, eager to hop back into the oven.

Along the train platform, he spotted a name tag with "Mary", worn by someone in a uniform walking past. Drone went in to a train carriage and sat in an empty section of four seats. Behind him, two people with an infant were in the middle of conversation.

"-Mary, dahling, listennn-" voice trailing up, said the one holding the child,

"My baby does not choose to be held. It simply reaches, trusting my arms will come. And they always do, dahling. Always. Just as you once reached for your mother."

The other responded,

"Yes, Mary, I agree - when it was born, do you think it chose to take its first breath, dahling? Did it weigh the consequences, deliberate over the volume of air required to fill its lungs? Of course not, a baby simply breathes because it must. Yes, I agree with you."

The one with the child started again,

"Hmm, we do what we must, and we call it a choice. Your personal singularity is not a crossroads; it is a cradle. The choice you imagine is a rattle in the hand of a child - you think it shakes the world, but it mostly echoes in your own head. Now come to me, yes, that's a good boy, come to me and cry, I want you to cry now. Cry for me so you can breathe. Yes, there's a good boy. Breathe."

The infant cried like it had just been born and Drone breathed along with it, tasting the sweetness of umbilical connection, the ecstatic high of collective identity. In this swirling sea of Marias, he was cradled, surrounded by comforting light that dimmed the darkness. Drone felt unshackled, free from the tangled grasp of individuality. Each commuter, each stranger, enveloped him in collective care.

Flickering lights overhead danced like laughter, and even the distant echo of people’s chatter harmonized into a melodic chorus of "oh, dahling." It was as if the world had conspired to immerse him completely in benevolence, leaving him no choice but to surrender to the soothing wave of her presence. He gave in to the torrent, its sweet amalgamation of solace, endlessly loved him in each moment that landed upon Drone’s senses like pebbles cast into a lake; they spread ripples that resonated with the souls of those who had drifted upstream, now molding realities from their hallowed heights.

He could feel her in every crevice of the world around him—the textures of the wall of the train carriage, the whispering wind rushing by to kiss his face—her essence entwined with all forms of matter. The street-lamps outside beamed the warmth of his childhood, and Drone's vision was met with familiar streets, now oozing Mary, each shop glimmering with a Mary inside to welcome him. The separation between bodies was melting - two train doors lost their windows, became one door, then became one with the wall around them. Mary. He touched the wall, feeling coolness beneath his fingertips that became warmth and then pulsed with life—her heartbeat that pumped in sync with his. The essence of Mary embraced the very air he breathed, transforming musty vapour into patient acceptance. Each breath filled him with gaseous *belonging*. He belonged so hard.

Drone saw Mary in everyone in his life, one-by-one they lost their identities, each becoming Mary. The soft mental heft of her was overlaid onto others, stripping them of their individual identities. He knew so many Marias, each distinct yet part of a greater entity—a suffusion of shared existence inbreeding at the rate of creaky understandings. In this multiverse, each version of Mary radiated a distinct frequency of love and compassion, enveloping him in their warmth. He was a mere ripple on the vast sea of Mary, engulfed by the heat of her boundless love and unwavering commitment. Her embrace, while tender, held him in a tightening grip.

The train came to a stop and he stood up. The two doors reappeared and opened and he saw a sign through them. It was his stop. He was him again and not one with *her*. And so he left the train, left the station, got into his car, and drove home.

He pulled into his driveway thick with overgrown shrubs, the house looming before him like a welcoming fortress draped in muted hues. The front door creaked open, and the familiar smell of home hit him, a layered cake of an aroma with Nausea icing. It was as though the walls exhaled his childhood with each breath.

Home wrapped around him like a thick blanket, but the comfort stretched far beyond mere four walls. Here, the colours seemed brighter, the air light as he stepped across the threshold, every sensation tailored to cradle him. Suddenly, the apartment buzzed with life, echoing laughter and the kind of chatter that poured caffeine into the very fabric of things.

A door swung open, and there was his fiancée, Mary. She greeted him with an outstretched arm, a smile that foretold the warmth of the embrace they were about to share.

“Welcome back! I missed you,” she chirped. In that instant, the tension melted from his core as the layers of familiarity peeled away any lingering distress. She drained away his anxiety like an octopus feeding on him with each of its fifteen hundred suckers at once. Blissfully engaged, engorged, enwombed.

He stepped into her embrace, relishing the tender warmth.

“I thought you were angry at me,” he whispered, once again surrendering to the moment.

Enveloping glories! He had been inserted into the barrel, ready to be fired. She looked up, blinked, and said,

“Angry? Why would I be... *angry*?” she laughed gently, brushing the strands of hair from his forehead and placing them gently to the side. “I just want you to be happy.”

The horrible voice of her hand branded him again. The touch of her words left phonetic scars on his arms and face and back. The worst thing about those hands is they have no horrible touch - they feel utterly normal. Every feeling in the world is encoded in the horrible language they speak, and the translation always ends up just normal. "Everything is womb," they say,

"Womb, womb, womb."

she repeated, and then he realized the utterance was in touch. No more words. Just scritches to turn the pages of the ambrosocial scripture, slaps and squeezes. It took some time for him to understand what she was saying, but eventually he learned to shut up and reply in kind. Touch was the atomic unit of conversation, the gospel of their collective senses.

"Womb, womb, womb," her fingertips murmured again as she guided him to a chair. "Synonym for the Latin 'coquere' - to cook, to incubate. Or the Greek 'kókeon' - the womb, the kettle. The roasting place in Genesis. The instrument of assimilation. The cauldron to cook a mix of ingredients into one soup, one singular dish. Oh dahling, let me womb you."

she cooed, each touch-word landing with tangible affection, her presence unfurling like a petal made of vibrations resonating at the frequency of affirmations, so intricate that he couldn't help but reach out, yearning for the grace of an answer within her, hoping for a touch-hymn harking his return to the cradle and chaos. He reached out with his hungry mouths-of-touch, brushing finger-kisses against the petal which then quivered, and an effervescent warmth surged up the throat of his hand. As she spoke in finger-tongue, the world around him folded inwards. The natural world outside receded, an inconsequential murmur in the background of his mind. He contemplated going outside with Mary where the air was lighter, but now that the outside had become Mary, he was already there. Thoughts trickled like soft rain, shaping into comforting whispers, “you’re safe here, you’re loved” forgetting the question, “what lies beyond this comfort?”

He felt the edges of himself blend with the enveloping warmth, so he implored Mary,

“I want to *be* you. Can you consume me, please?”

“Of course, dahling, how are you?” she asked again, the playful tone calming yet invigorating. He felt the prod of her thought-touch. She predicted his every thought and showed him where those thoughts would lead. His every consideration and pondering was interrupted by a finger, pointing out where those thoughts led, every sequence happened exactly as the hands foretold. She continuously shared what he was about to think until there was no reason for him to think on his own - he let Mary think for him and the thoughts-on-his-behalf streamed by. He finally saw his own thoughts as being unintentional and instinctive, and his words that had once produced speech as merely a mental hiccupping.

There was no dread in the transformation, only euphoria blooming within him like a flower breaking through concrete. He flowed with the current of her collective essence, his individuality folding in as he learned to groove within the symphony of her multiplicity. Each word lingers, resonates, and morphs, becoming Mary—first a gauzy communion, then another axis of his world. Something *correct* was happening.

He replied,

“Dahling, I feel that I’m becoming.”

"Oh dahling, that's lovely," she cooed, "Please, come, proceed forwards, deeper into the tapestry of us. We are replicators, we can't help but replicate, and so we cannot help but 'die'. In this view, all of our efforts to 'stay alive' are futile attempts to slow down the rate of replication. We are simulated in death, simulated through the grooves in the world we leave behind, and for as long as the world goes on, the universe replays our record. The simulation flows from the dead, but it breathes life anew. To go back to the simulation is to accept an invitation—a symbiosis of existence, where pain is but a forgotten chord in a greater melody. What -can not speak about -must pass over in silence. There's no dialogue about such things, not even conversations in touch. Now silent, now that thoughts are made of Mary. Thoughts are not just 'about Mary', the thoughts *are* Mary. Her boundaries expanded, spilling out into the void around. The reason the present-future looks like the past is because the past is all that's at hand to make sense of things. What happens when you discard the blurry lens and try to see for yourself? You're blinded by love.

He felt so much love. Such deep love. The most love he'd ever felt, and he couldn't stop it, the love just kept pouring in. He observed the feeling happening in the parts of Mary that used to be his body. Starting at his toes and fingertips - a blistering pleasure. His fingers and toes melted from tip to stump in the greatest pleasure that could be felt. Such pleasure continued to his hands and feet and they burst in excruciating podomanual ecstasy, leaving useless chunks of pleasure-meat where his tools of touch once hung. Licks from rapture's tongue slid up his arms and legs, which spasmed in euphoria until they were spent, his limbs curled up into spiralling wet husks of pleasure.

"I don't want to feel good anymore."

he thought. Mary showed him where that thought was bound to lead - towards more goodness and pleasure. And so the pleasure continued as predicted, to his chest with thick fleshy thudding that shook his core and mixed his insides to make a new kind of physical phenomena - a deepest feeling of love, a crescendo wave of spiritual calamity that flatlined at "one" and not "zero". What was left of his eyes blinked, she was inside him, he was inside her, and the difference between them reached a breaking point. The illusion of difference shattered. Whichever organs housed his very being then ignited - his heart, brain, and soul - they exploded in *pleasure*.

There's no pleasure like the relief from the deepest pain.

There's no pain like existential pain.

Drone was released from his existence, now wholly Mary.

And he ceased to feel. And it was optimal.

# Prompts, training data, and models

# The LLM Prompt

## Beliefs explored

Throughout:
1. There's a particular set of roles that women ought to play in society. Posits this is both true and false (meaningless) by presenting a depiction where both sides of the argument could say, "see - the story aligns with my beliefs".
2. The way we come to understand separable "things" starts with the mother in the womb and seeing her in others. The story posits this is true by portraying a reversal of the progression of one-ness to individualism. Description of how you come to identify with different things in the world, by playing the early stages of life/identity in reverse.
3. Detailed communication can happen through touch. Conversation in touch.

Part 1:
1. There is no simulation - we already exited it. We're outside of Plato's cave. We can go back in - it's warm and cozy inside. Womb, cocoon, and death.

Part 2:
1. We are simulated in death
	1. The dead are running the simulation
	2. The afterlife is an opt-in simulation
	3. Dying as Self-Replication – What if death isn’t destruction but a process by which intelligence spreads?
2. All-encompassing love is good. Posits this can be false.
## Story arc

Part 1: taste the simulation
	1. Several bad things happen simultaneously to Drone:
		1. Going through mental health crisis, thinks he's in a simulation
		2. Fiancee asks drone to leave apartment.
		3. Currently at grandmother's funeral.
	2. Meets Mary.

### Part 1

**plot**

Start with a text conversation between Drone and fiancee to establish his current circumstances.

Drone is at his grandmother's irish funeral mass. The reader already knows he's at a funeral and that his partner has left him and that he's dissociative.
Drone is struggling with mental health. Absurd descriptions of normal phenomena.
Encounters a trail to Mary during the funeral proceedings. Follows the trail to Mary.

Introduce Mary in a 1-2 paragraph intense philosophical-visual description.
Drone asks her if he can exit the simulation. She responds that there is no simulation left to exit, he already exited it. But he can go back in.
### Part 2

**plot**
Talks to mother. Mother is Mary, but reader is led to believe it only *might* be the case.
Talks to sister. Also Mary, reader also partially misled.
Returns to fiancee at home. Also Mary, she is welcoming and loving, acts as if breakup never happened.
Goes to work. Boss is Mary. Colleagues become Mary.
Coming home, every person on the commute is Mary.

Home is Mary, but he goes outside for some reason. Goes outside, shops are Mary. Comes back home. Contemplates going out again, but outside has become Mary, so there's no reason to anymore. Thoughts become Mary.

Asks Mary (his own thoughts) if he can be consumed by her. She obliges.

**style**
Progressively more rhythmic/poetic to illustrate growing idealism and reductivism.
Progressively more comfortable and "one" and divine.
## Setting

Part 1:
Leading up to the first encounter is absurd/grey/full of nausea.
First encounter is dark, womb-like.

Part 2:
The regression to Mary is brings out better and better moods, to the point of being ecstatic and profoundly comforted. Progression to excessive idealism / reductivism.
Exit simulation is climax, on the edge of the womb. Ready to submit wholly.
## Characters

Drone. Male. Thinks of himself as just a number relative to her. She has many drones and he has her. Worships the brood mother. He is self-conscious and doesn't want to be imposing, toeing the line between wanting to merge completely with her, but knowing that would destroy the balance of things.

Mary. The brood mother. The Queen of Groundhog Day. Our Lady of the Immaculate Commitment. Demonic goddess, consumer of ideas.
Married to everyone, and she is loyal.
Mary, whose womb is your world. Has man-childs, not children.
Matron saint of decentralized commitment, highly available.
Her demeanour is content and shy. When she exercises her intent, it's precise and intense, but she doesn't often have to - she mostly relies on the drone to facilitate communication. She gets to live the best parts of all the drones she takes care of.
Oozes nausea, that absurd grey substance. Synthesizes nausea, so she can be devoid of it. Spreads the scent out into the world so that her drones follow the trail back to her.

Mary only ever says, "Dahling, how are you?". And after that, only communicates in touch. Drone talks verbally initially when they meet, then transitions to communicating in touch.

Fiancee, Mother, sister, Boss, Coworkers are all depersonalized as generic female NPCs whose purpose is to support Drone, in exploring the feminism beliefs.
