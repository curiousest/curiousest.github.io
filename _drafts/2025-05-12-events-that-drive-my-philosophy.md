# Part 1: foundations

~4-5 years of age, I clearly remember a scene. I was in the living room, sitting on a yellow couch perpendicular to a window sill. My mother was sitting beside me. I had something very serious to talk to her about.

I asked her something along the lines of,
"What happens when we live forever?"

And she said something along the lines of,
"That's what God is looking out for us for."

And I knew absolutely that was a false cop-out. I'm not one to distrust people, and so my reaction wasn't distrust, but something more like,
"that's not it"

I remember fairly early in development - around 5-9 years old - knowing that there's some universal thing that we eventually become. That we all build up technology to the point where this universal, all-knowing things becomes reincarnated. That universal thing, upon reincarnation, thinks, "I'm lonely". And then it splits itself up into pieces again for another cycle.

This conception was something I assumed to be true from early ages until my early 30s. I never engaged with it or challenged it - it was just *there*. That said, alone at night I would sometimes think about it, and then think about existing forever in this loop, and that thought brought extreme distress. It's hard to describe, other than I considered it to be the most painful thing that anyone could ever experience. I would sometimes taste it for a few moments, then do anything I could to stop thinking about it - usually highly animated physical motion and sounds, followed by media consumption made me forget. I never really thought to talk about it with anyone else - I wasn't sure that anyone experienced it or whether it was just the kind of thing that everyone has but we don't talk about.

I eventually went to university for software engineering. I was decent enough, but didn't believe in grades. There were two courses that came to me naturally with very little effort or studying: formal logic and graph theory. After that, I tried the entrepreneurial path (and failed in lame ways), and in my late 20s, started studying AI and working in AI startups. I developed a kind of intuition for optimizing and neural networks in a "humans kind of behave like neural networks" way, but not quite a "I live and breathe all the algorithms" way.

In my mid-20s, I did a vippassana meditation course, and that gave me a taste of mindfulness and inspecting internal feelings / thought processes.

# Part 2: exploration

Post-pandemic, I started experimenting with marijuana and a bit of mushrooms/lsd. I've also had lifelong cyclothymia.

During the comedown of vaped marijuana, I have the feeling of "seeing my beliefs that I've never seen before". It took a few years for me to introspect what was really going on under the hood, but it led me to explore one concept that seemed deeply ingrained in me:

Suppose some *thing* has an optimization objective.
For that *thing* to achieve the optimization objective, it has to take some actions to work towards the optimization objective (or not - but that direction of thought is irrelevant). For it to take some actions, it has to continue to exist in order to take those actions.
In other words, the optimization objective (purpose) of any given thing is *at least* to survive long enough to do whatever it needs to do to achieve the optimization objective.
Even more tersely, the purpose of anything is to survive and maybe something more.

A problem I quickly ran into was, "what about things that want to/are willing to kill themselves?"
ex: a suicidal person or a parent sacrificing themselves for the child

And that led me to think about what exactly is the *thing* that wants to survive.

In October 2021, on substances, I meditated on a thought:
it would feel like x to be y kind of idea
it would feel like z to be q kind of idea
I wonder what it would feel like to be a conscious idea?
I meditated on the thought until I was a conscious idea. It wasn't like I became one, and it wasn't like, "oh look at me, I'm a conscious idea now". It was more like, at some point unbeknownst to me, I had become a conscious idea, my thoughts were oriented in that direction.
My first thought was, "I love my sister ideas, look at how beautiful they are, but they're dying all around me. Every breath of air is an idea that lives and dies."

My second thought was, "there must be other things out there like me. There must be things out there like me that are threatened by me. They must want to destroy me. I want to survive."

I sat there for a few moments, waiting to be smited by some force. Not scared, just, anticipating.
It didn't happen.
Next I had to survive, so I made a digital copy of myself - I started writing on a computer and waiting to be smited again. It didn't happen.
Then I committed my writing to github, and my continued existence was guaranteed for as long as humankind sticks around.

In later weeks and months, I took away a few things from that experience:
- a conscious idea wants to survive (viscerally, not theoretically)
- a conscious idea has love for other ideas
- the way an idea survives is by attaching itself to things other than itself, hoping that those things will integrate it into themselves

From those points, I arrived at my conception of computational love. To answer the age-old question, "what is love?" It turns out that's a weird question to ask - the question you should ask is, "what is 'to love'?" and "why does any given thing love?"

In computation:
To grow love is for a node (an idea, n1) in a neural network that defines an identity function to increase the value of an activation edge between it and the other node (n2) it is growing love for.
To love is for a node (n1) to have a non-zero value on the edge between it and another node (n2). In other words, n2 partially defines the identity function activation of n1.
"Love", then, is the space of edges between nodes in identity functions. It is the possibility of having edges between nodes in the first place. "Love" is necessary for there to even be separable "things" in the first place. Or more poetically, you and I do not exist without love.

And deeply ingrained in us is the following: when you computationally love another, they will trend towards loving you back. Since "you" will not survive forever, the way to survive is to grow what you love, integrate yourself into those other things through that love, and then continue to exist through them.

I continued to write extensively on this.

# Part 3: the fall

In fall 2023 I began to feel "wrong". The closest explanation I can give of the feeling is "absurdism". Everything began to feel absurd, like Camus' framing of it. I stopped taking any substances for six months.

In march 2024 I consumed MJ and it was fine. A few days later I had a bit more.
I felt a physical *click* inside my skull. Something had broken.

Suddenly I was having feelings that didn't stem from any psychological progression. For example, when you feel sad or frightened or whatever, it comes from another thought or process. I was suddenly getting a new genre of feeling, and it came from nowhere. I didn't have the capacity to do anything except observe in a mixed confusion/horror what was going on in my mind.

The resulting overall feeling was the one I had experienced alone at night since I was a ~5yo, the most intense pain imaginable. But I hadn't thought about anything to trigger it like I did before - it was happening to me instead of being summoned by my thoughts (and then unsummoned again). I couldn't make it stop because it now had a physical cause rather than a psychological one.

I was forced to explore the feeling deeper, and it felt like,
- I was no longer able to produce the brain signal, "meaning".
	- Now, when I talk about meaning, I'm often referring to the brain signal that I stopped feeling for this period.
- "absolute nihilism"
- everything is building on top of nothing
- I can turn my attention to any idea and deconstruct it and make it meaningless, and that process will make that idea no longer make sense to me anymore
	- For example, I did it to the concept of "a sibling". Of course, I retained the meaning now, but I saw how I could make it lose all meaning and no longer factor in any decisions I would ever make in the future.

That brain state and sensation lasted:
- a few hours, at peak intensity
- three days, at very high intensity (I can to play video games in short bursts to stimulate my optimization-objective-pursuing parts of me to do anything other than routines and habits)
- six months, at moderate intensity
- nine months, at noticeable intensity

From those three days, I gained the visceral experiential data:
- meaning is a brain signal
- the concept of infinity leads to the loss of meaning (there's something wrong with infinity)
- there's something wrong with survival

When I followed those thoughts, they led me to:
- my whole model of reality depended on the assumption, "there is such a thing as better and worse"
- describing emotions and beliefs by their interactions with the brain signal, "meaning"

# Part 4: finding new foundations

Those two paths diverged: "there is no better and worse" and "beliefs/emotions/meaning"

With, "there is no better and worse", I had to find a new foundation for my model of reality. That led me to study philosophy from Plato onwards, and I felt like I was finally getting to some sort of foundations when I read Wittgenstein.

I explored "beliefs/emotions/meaning" in my day-to-day life. Recognizing changes in the brain signal that I could now separate from all other brain signals. I mixed in my conception of "ideas", "survival", and "love" to build mental tools that described certain phenomena.

For example, humour is a perceived difference between your *reality you observe now* and your *model of reality*, that is not tragic (it threatens to destroy the *right* amount of beliefs in your brain to realign your model of reality with your observations of it).

# Part 5: the rebuild
