<div>To new readers: don't read this post first. It is not a story.</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>This post was written entirely while trying to sleep in the darkness of 2am, albeit fragmented. Yes, even t'intro'n'title. I have paper and pen beside my bed because attempting to sleep is when ideas choose to invade. This particular sleep attempt was abnormal in the quantity. Unfortunately, mostly words... not many/any ideez. </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Let's start off with some deep imagery...but not "deep imagery."</div>
<br /><div>1: 'Discrimination is bad. This is morally undeniable, but why do I feel a suspicious sensation...like I've been brainwashed... Maybe the puppetmaster mirror-shine of feverant beleif is wearing off with scruff experience to reveal an opaque looking glass.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>2: 'My writing style comes from an ugly nowhere; of emails, technical reports, instant messaging... No writing for the fun and testing, only (ironically) to provide maximal understanding with minimal content.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>3: 'Wouldn't it be ironic to go into university learning to write programs and leave it writing blogs?'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>4: 'My blog: reads like poetry, talks like drunk.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>5: 'I'm satisfied when my work is good and gratified when it's recognized.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>6: 'I love the hypomania that preceeds the storm of consumption.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>7: 'The midnight prawns sleep tonight.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>8: 'Why do I play at words in wordplay when I know words are doomed?'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>9: 'I only talk about myself and no one; no in-between.</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>10: 'The shower is where I get the fewest ideas and greatest relaxation.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>11: 'We are in an age of manually recording everything.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>12: 'How to be different...step 1: have awesome friends+family (how many ppl have truly awesome friends+family?)'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>13: 'Fortunately, muscle memory dosn't much follow the degeneration of muscles.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>14: '; and i ideated many ideas as my edia generator idled down.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>15: 'I eat words for midnight.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>16: 'Mastery of the English language is boring; I would prefer to play with it.'</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Don't feel like this blog is a guilty pleasure. Share it with friends; share it with strangers. Give them a taste of new modernity - what is more modern than a 21yr old software engineering student / aspiring entrepreneur / online social networking enthusiast / art lover?</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>I will quickly fail fresh and acquire more taste. Eat me up and share.</div>
