A: Action
Start your short story off with an action. Your protagonist should do something active. His body should be in motion in some way.
B: Background
In the next part, you will insert the context of when in time, where on the map, and which point in life your protagonist is.
D: Development
The plot happens during the development stage. Now we see how the beginning action, the protagonist's backstory, and his consequent actions drive the plot forward.
C: Climax
A key narrative twist happens. The protagonist experiences his most exciting, scary, enlightening moment.
E: Ending
During the winding down part of the story, the reader finds out how the ordeal or adventure changed the protagonist.

Write a very short story - not more than 200 words - about a trip to the doctor or dentist using the ABDCE structure. Identify the structural elements in your story. My example is provided below:

One night when I was eight years old I opened a bag of Doritos to eat while watching television. (A) Doritos were my favorite snack to eat as a child. Nacho Cheese was my favorite flavor. (B) I loved sitting in the dark hearing the “crunch, crunch, crunch” of the chips. I’d sit there, crunching my chips, but didn’t eat the chips with a napkin (what kid does?) and would forget about the powder that accumulated on my fingertips. As it got later and I got sleepier, I kept rubbing my eyes, my fingertips covered in Doritos Nacho Cheese powder. (D) When it was time for bed, I went to brush my teeth, looked in the mirror, and saw two large bags under my eyes. The Doritos Nacho Cheese powder had pooled into two large sacks underneath my eyeballs. I started screaming and crying. (C) The next day, my grandmother took me to the doctor who put industrial strength eye drops into my eyes to flush out the powder. (E)

Remember, the action in this story isn’t the actual doctor’s office visit. The action is what LEADS you to the doctor’s office.

(A) My boyfriend called me ugly. I hit him and cried. I'm sure he'll find a way to explain how it was my fault, but I remember how I felt. He assualted one of the pillars of my identity - my style. (B) I've always been into high fashion, and Georgia Jagger is my favourite model. She has a quirky face, but always looks chic. It's because of her buck teeth. It's intentional - the rest of her looks beautiful and that one intentionally "ugly" aspect gives her a distinct style. It makes her, overall, a more beautiful person. That's why I've always felt attached to the gap between my front teeth. (D) But, my boyfriend said my teeth "could be improved". He has terrible taste. I asked my colleagues at work and they agreed. Terrible taste. (C) Most people have terrible taste. I went to the orthodontist to see what I would look like with perfect teeth. I looked "better" in the adjusted photo. (E) Six months later, I'm prettier than Georgia Jagger... in the eyes of most people.
