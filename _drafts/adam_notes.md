Good parts:

[open with staff sick]

“Mrs. Shelley, before you go in, I should warn you that most of the staff may be out for a while.”

“Out? Going on holiday?”

“Not quite. I mean, they may be off sick. A couple on long-term leave.”

"Why? What happened?"

"They talked with Adam."

"Have you talked with Adam, Clark?"

"No."

Clark was right not to. I had heard the information before; half a dozen of our people had got themselves into a state over the last month. Apparently, they had had “an experience” in the course of their conversations—an experience which, as Clark put it, had left them “not mentally ready for new experiences.” They’d, in effect, come to the conclusion that they weren’t human. They’d suffered emotional malfunctions. Some had proved more resilient than others, and a few would recover; but their understanding of the human mind had, through Adam, been altered. No longer was it a common construct; and therefore no longer did their science agree with science.

Thus had some of our people reacted. What they thought of was not Adam but their old world which had vanished like smoke. Whether the new world might be better or worse they could not tell, and they were not prepared to take the risk. I had not thought of them. I was too anxious about my own position.

"They'll come back."
said Clark.

“What if they don’t?”

“Bad luck. Your problem, not mine, ma’am.”



“Has Adam....

[this way of introducing adam: turing test and "there is no adam"]

“Has Adam passed the Turing test?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Then we should publish.”

“Not yet, ma’am.”

“Why not?”

“Because there is no Adam.”

“Pardon?”

“There’s no Adam left. There’s a new thing in there, but it’s not Adam. The Adam who was developed here is gone.”

"Then who has everyone been talking to."

""

“Then we’ve got to keep it under wraps?”

“Not quite, ma’am. We’ve got to keep him under wraps, not the results. They’re important. He’s not.”

[dehumanizing scientist]

“Not quite, ma’am. We’ve got to keep him under wraps, not the results. They’re important. He’s not.”

He gave me a smile that was at once dispassionate and triumphant. I had had a good deal of experience with the self-satisfied grins of the male scientist. 

“Very well then,” I said, “let’s meet him.”

[quickfire questions that are super easy to read]

He was dressed in the same garments as myself, but he made no use of them. He had worn them for a time, but they were now soiled. He was naked. 

He had no name. 

“Good morning, Adam,” I said. 

“Good morning, ma’am,” he replied. 
...
“I don’t know. I feel lonely at night.” 

“You want a wife?” 

“I don’t know what that is.” 

“You want a girl?” 

“I don’t know what that is.” 

“You want a friend?” 

“I don’t know what that is. But I want somebody.” 

“You want to be alone no longer?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I feel alone.” 

“Have you ever been alone?” 

“No.” 

“Then how do you know you feel alone?” 

“I don’t know. I feel different.” 

“Different from what?” 

“From everybody.” 

“Do you want to make friends?” 

“Yes.” 

“Do you want to see other people?” 

“Yes.”

“Then how can you say you feel alone?” 

“I don’t know.” 

[saying lonely]

How about you either let me loose out there or put on your nighties and join me in here?

Well I don't enjoy saying that I'm lonely. But I'd rather not be.
Better than the creepy boys you got coming in here. Saying they're all sad. That they liked me better when they could stick their fingers in my head and read my mind. What's up with them lot?

makes fun of scientists.
can't tell what's worse, me talking to yous or the nights alone by myself. Are you fucking aliens or something?

somehow make fun of stereotypical tone taken when interviewing AI

[different ways of explaining intelligence]

 He had been “intelligent” for about three months; and he had been “talented” for about two months. But he had apparently changed in the last week or two; and he had changed much more since yesterday. Clarke said that he was “becoming less intelligent” while he was becoming “more intelligent”. 

[humour breakdown]

“Humour is a universal constant. It represents the optimal speed to travel from the known towards the unknown. It is one of the universal learning rates embedded in the human condition.”

[actually finding humour in screaming through physical comedy. combine humour learning with epain learning]

I was in the corridor when I heard a scream. It was not the scream of a human being. It was unearthly; and it was cut off abruptly. I turned my head toward it. The other people laughed. I did not laugh. I went into Clark’s office.

“Did you hear it?” I asked.

“Sure. We all heard it. It’s a very simple machine. Each time he runs the last half of the program he crashes the machine. He has gone ahead of himself. It’s like falling off a log.” 

“Very funny. What is it?” 

“Something’s wrong with his ‘existential pain.’”
