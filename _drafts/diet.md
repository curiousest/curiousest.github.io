I had an extreme diet - and not the average extreme. I've obsessed about eating efficiently for more than ten years, seeking the lowest time and decision-making overhead. I took pleasure in the dogmatic sacrifices I had to make: unpalatable food, absense of variety, suppression of taste sensation, missing out on social bonding over meals... It didn't matter - my time and mental energy was better spent elsewhere. I ate the same thing for breakfast and lunch for the last few years. More than half of my calories were from [one food item](https://queal.com/en/). I adored the idea of my diet, and it worked... until I became more serious about fitness. I saw [a dietician](http://www.thesportsnutritioncoach.com/) who, steadfast, argued that my diet was interfering with my goals. This is what the dietician prescribed. This is the habit I built. This is my diet.

## Habit design

More on how I build habits here: (to be written)

I want to look better. That's the long-term reward of the diet. There are other rewards, but they don't inspire me. Before pursuing this diet, I struggled to gain lean muscle mass. The last two times I bulked, I gained 5-8kg more bodyfat than I should have. My diet and training habits make it possible to gain muscle mass without excessive bodyfat. The reward inspired me to change my lifestyle and identify as "someone who is on a strict diet".

Initially, I had to invest in meeting a dietician and heeding their advice: to stop eating some foods, to revamp what I food I buy, and to try out new recipes. Now that my habit is established, I have to regularly invest time and effort in buying the right food, not buying the wrong food, and having food conveniently available at home and work.

I make three food decisions each day: morning at home, midday at work or on-the-go, and evening at home. I don't have the willpower to make hard decisions at every mealtime every day. I need the best choices to be the most convenient ones. In the morning and evening at home, the process is foolproof:

I stand at the kitchen counter.

I look at the list of meals to choose from. I pick two.

I eat for ten minutes.

One minute later, I've cleaned up.

15-30 minutes invested. Those meals satisfy every craving. They fit any schedule.

My midday meal has a higher risk of derailing the habit. I may have less than ten minutes to eat and I may not have any place to prepare food or store perishable ingredients. I may feel peer pressure to get takeout food with friends or colleagues. I need ultra convenient options - meals with seconds of preparation and cleanup time that I can carry around for the day.

- Oat bars
- Oat flapjacks (baked in advance and frozen) 

And that's my diet habit. The most convenient option for any short-term decision about food is also the best choice for my long-term goals.

Caveat: when people pressure me into eating/drinking, I have to make short-term decisions that are often sub-optimal. The way I deal with this is that the default choice is "no", especially for people I know well. For people that don't know me as well, it's difficult to explain my dogma. If food is the medium of socialization and there's no way to avoid it, I mentally prepare myself to make good choices. I pick meals that are as similar to my meal list as possible.


========

The key considerations for the diet were:
- eat at the same time every day
- eat the same # of calories every day
- every meal comes from a list (1/10 days I eat a meal that doesn't come from the list)
-> groceries are repeatable (easy to re-order online or be in grocery store. You look at what's running low and get more. You don't eat anything else, so there's little temptation or opportunity for weakness.)
- say "no" to people trying to make you eat other things
- don't drink calories (alcohol, soft drinks, etc)

Everything I consume (except for that one meal every ten days or so) is from a preapproved list, so my defaults are perfect. I have minimal decision-making overhead about food - the hardest decision I have to make is, "which of these two meals will I eat right now?". The meals are the easiest options available to me - it would be more time and energy-consuming to order delivery food, find unhealthy food, or go out to eat. It's so much easier to stay on course when the most convenient option is by far the best.

Correct defaults:

Low time and decision making overhead
low activation energy

### Long-term thinking / plan

### Mindset

"This is what I eat now. This is my identity."
Start when you have willpower (vacation, not stressed, etc.)

## Calorie count is paramount

Gaining or losing body weight is determined by calorie intake - the further away from maintenance calories, the faster you gain or lose body weight. It's paramount for the diet to hit the right calorie count. The diet has to hit the right calorie count consistently and accurately, each day and week hitting the right calorie count. The next most important factor is consuming enough protein every day.
