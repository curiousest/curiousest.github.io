===================

I want two bedsheets. I want competence.
===================

Winnie rushed past the store, slowed, then stopped as she remembered she wanted two new sets of bedsheets. Inside the store she browsed with intent, pretending to not hear or see the approaching store employee with their warm and well-intentioned request to help. Others didn't exist until she needed them to, or at least that's how everyone felt around her.

Winnie made several rings around the store, finding just one of the two bedsheets she wanted. Store staff entered Winnie's universe of necessity and she began surveying those within eyeshot, looking for someone wearing unfashionably formal and bland clothes. Targeted,

"Um, hi. Can you help me please? I can only find one and I need two."

The person she accosted gave her a surprised, then filthy look,

"I don't work here."

The previously ignored store staff interjected and offered to help as the accosted exited her universe. Winnie, exhuding no signs of recognition or remorse, crowed with growing impatience,

"I can only find one of these and I need two."

The store staff disappeared for ten minutes into a storage room and returned empty-handed. Nevertheless, a carrot was dangled, an optimistic promise was made, and the staff brought Winne to the checkout desk. The checkout clerk gathered Winnie's home details for a delivery in the next few days, and executed the transaction. Simple.

"Your two sets of bedsheets will arrive on Monday."

A red flag raised up the back of Winnie's spine until it flew,

"Is this some trick? I have one here and I wanted one more."

The clerk clicked and keyed away. Ten more minutes passed. Winnie's anger continued to rise.

"We refunded your order, but those are the last two left. They have to go through returns processing before anyone can buy them again. It'll take another day or so."

Winnie threw the bedsheets at the clerk and stormed off. Winnie replayed the memory. Most of the irrelevant details and people were forgotten - the welcoming staff, the bystander. It was, however, viscerally clear who and what deserved vindiction.
