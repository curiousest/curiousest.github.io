# Eulogy of an idea

No one is dying. Why do we act like someone is dying?
A community is dying. An idea will die.
An idea, borne by Misty and Milo, ten years ago.
A worthy idea - it grew and it fostered growth.
We built a relationship with this idea, fused into our self-identity.
Now it's dying and so is part of us.
But we still live - strong people are harder to kill.

Long live CrossFit Fortitude.
