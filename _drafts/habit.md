I'm good at building habits. I have a lifetime of practice, mostly failing. I reflected on the habits that stuck and found patterns. All the habits are now merged into into my identity. I built supporting structures in my life, feeding them willpower.

## Committing my identity

My main consideration for any lifestyle change is, "how will this fit into my life?" I brainstorm as many situations as I can and visualize results. I research approaches and others' subjective experience. It's a passive mental activity, background processing for days to weeks. I think about it when I walk, shower, daydream...

If I covet the pay-off, I will be inspired.

If I find inspiration, I will explore it.

If I figure out how to make it work, I will identify with it.

If the habit is part of me, I will make time for it.

If I establish the habit, I will evangelize it.

This is my life now. I am an __.

### Example: a good diet

A diet habit will make me look better, feel better, look better, spend less time on food, look better... I contemplated the possibilities and implications until I found a path to commitment. My diet became part of my identity. I am someone who has a strict diet. When someone talks about food, my perspective is, "as someone on a strict diet." When social events center around food, I require special consideration.

Why doesn't everyone eat correctly? They probably don't have the awareness. I share.

### Example: video games abstinence

Not consuming video games will give me more productivity, more time for the things I wish I would do more of. I contemplated the possibilities and implications until I found a path to commitment. I became a former gamer. Gaming is part of my identity and so is its abstinence. If someone talks about games, I excitedly engage and embellish the past. When the conversation drifts to present gaming, I apologize for not being up-to-date, but empathize with the passion. I'm a former gamer.

Although I enjoyed video games, they weren't bringing me long-term rewards. Are they the best time investment? Thought planted.

## Investing in infrastructure

Making time for the habit is halfway there - I can still waste my time. I'm human. I have low-willpower moments when I make poor short-term decisions. I need the default choices to be good ones. If I make time for the habit and the most convenient choices are good ones, the habit is going to work.

It takes effort to make the default choices good. I have to put upfront effort into making good choices more convenient. I also put upfront effort into making the bad choices inconvenient. Sometimes I even put *more* effort into subverting bad choices.

### Example: a good diet

I go to buy food. I pick good food. I avoid bad food.

=> a balanced investment

### Example: restricting media consumption

I bookmark and mentally whitelist "good options". I block bad options: I enable parental controls on my tablet and phone to blacklist websites, I change my computer /etc/hosts file to blacklist domains, I log into my router to blacklist IPs. I get other people to hide my gaming consoles. 

On Youtube I unfollow or block channels/content that I deem unproductive. On Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter/Instagram, I unfollow friends and contacts until all newsfeed content is benign.

I go to a new extreme when I have high willpower and regret from a media binge.

=> investing in sabotage

- the long-term return is high and inspiring
- so that I can think, "this is my life now"
- so that I make time for it
- the default choices for the habit are good, so that when my willpower is low, I still make the correct decisions


If I can design the lifestyle change and the default choices for that habit are good ones, it will succeed.

The key considerations for the diet were:
- eat at the same time every day
- eat the same # of calories every day
- every meal comes from a list (1/10 days I eat a meal that doesn't come from the list)
-> groceries are repeatable (easy to re-order online or be in grocery store. You look at what's running low and get more. You don't eat anything else, so there's little temptation or opportunity for weakness.)
- say "no" to people trying to make you eat other things
- don't drink calories (alcohol, soft drinks, etc)

Everything I consume (except for that one meal every ten days or so) is from a preapproved list, so my defaults are perfect. I have minimal decision-making overhead about food - the hardest decision I have to make is, "which of these two meals will I eat right now?". The meals are the easiest options available to me - it would be more time and energy-consuming to order delivery food, find unhealthy food, or go out to eat. It's so much easier to stay on course when the most convenient option is by far the best.

Correct defaults:

Low time and decision making overhead
low activation energy
What happens when the easiest option is the best option? Fireworks. Unicorn.
