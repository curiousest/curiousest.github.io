## who am I? why am I here?

do you know what happens when you think about these questions for too long? I do.

three years ago I consumed large quantities of very special substances
then I developed a messiah complex - I had figured out something very special, so I started writing a very special book
then I had an existential crisis - I realized it's all meaningless, I caught a nasty case of nihilism, I just about lost my mind, and I kept writing the very meaningless book
I took a year sabbatical to do that whole nihilism, spiritual exploration, philosophy study thing - I synthesized all my experiences, and I kept writing the very complex book

and when I finished manually writing the book, yes I typed every key with my hands, how passe huh? when I finished writing a first draft, LLMs were in full swing, and my profession has been in AI for the past eight years, so I thought I'd experiment with some LLMs before revisiting my manuscript
