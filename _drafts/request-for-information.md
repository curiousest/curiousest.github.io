First thing to do when someone asks you to manually provide information: figure out how that information will be used.

Similar to building something that provides information - figure out how it's going to be used. When there's a bigger investment (building a thing), we're going to put a bit more effort into understanding how it'll be used. When it feels like it should be one-time, low effort, we often gloss over that and leave it implicit.

Product problem. Don't go too far, don't assume too much. Do exactly right.

Obvious example: authors writing a novel always say, "keep the audience in mind"

Not-so-obvious real-world examples:

- Project estimates, a bit more obvious (are you going to tell the customer? are you doing capacity planning? )
- RICE estimates. wtf, I'm an infrastructure team - what is this even used for? Measuring end-user impact when I'm helping a team that's helping a team that's helping a team.
    - Sometimes, you can't clarify, and just have to make do with what you have. In this situation, I chose not to provide the information, because my estimates would be so wildly ranged that they wouldn't mean anything and I didn't know how this information that doesn't mean anything would be used.
    - Sometimes, the act of gathering information is the intention of the request - the requester doesn't really intend to use it. It can be a legitimate ask, though, kind of like writing a business plan that gets immediately discarded.
- Another non-estimate example... metrics???

It can be possible to trust that the requester will process your inexact response, and errors won't really matter. Eg: census. Eg: voting "who do you want to be in office vs. where is your vote best-spent"
