## Comparing LLM providers

Which LLM to choose? There are hundreds. It's a bit like picking what actor to play the character in the scene you've set up. Imagine you're in the early days of cinema where directors don't really know what "good acting" looks like, never mind audiences. Yes, anyone can call tell when someone is obviously 100x "better" than someone else, but given a bunch of actors who perform roughly the same, it comes down to factors other than their acting abilities like whether you know their family. You're probably just going to pick the LLM based on which logo you vibe with and that's not such a bad way to decide.

I picked ChatGPT because:
- I don't have a PC that can run the big open source models
- I'm ok with giving them my data
- I've been using ChatGPT since it came out
### Corporate vs. open source

When you submit your data to an LLM company, they can use it to train their LLMs. All the major LLM providers have options to opt out of them training on your data, but some people are sensitive about their data and refuse to give it to LLM providers. I would be happy for someone else to sound like me or use my ideas, but my livelihood isn't tied up in my literary IP.

If you are sensitive about sharing data, you can run LLMs locally. The open source LLMs that have similar performance to corporate LLM providers require powerful PCs. There are lower-performance LLMs that run on most PCs. If you want to try running an open source model on your computer, check out Ollama.
### Qualitative comparison

I liked ChatGPT's feedback the most, but all the LLMs I tried felt similar-enough to be interchangeable:
- Claude brings up the same points of feedback as ChatGPT, but it doesn't deliver them with the same *oomph*. Claude also had some points where it didn't seem to "get it" - like the *Themes and Philosophy* or *Originality* feedback.
- After my first read, I dismissed Gemini's feedback, but looking at it again, it's great. Maybe just a little too succinct. When I reviewed other stories with it, I saw repetition of certain points of feedback like "*Create a clear narrative structure with a beginning, middle, and end.*"
- Llama 2 is a tiny, outdated open source model. Its response is more like bad acting, taking on a character rather than doing what the character would actually do. It has a some poignant insights, but seems a bit confused in parts, and by the end it became cringe to read, like I have to wipe slime off of me after consuming the writing style.

Alright, let's dissect this piece and highlight its numerous shortcomings. This so-called "story" is a convoluted mess that fails on multiple levels. Here's a structured breakdown of its major flaws:

1. Structure and Coherence:
   - The narrative is disjointed and difficult to follow.
   - There's no clear plot or progression, just a series of abstract musings.
   - The use of fragmented sentences and unconventional formatting is jarring and pretentious.

2. Character and Point of View:
   - The narrator/protagonist is poorly defined and inconsistent.
   - The constant shifting between "I am" and "I was" is confusing and unnecessary.
   - There's no character development or relatable elements for the reader to latch onto.

3. Setting and World-building:
   - The cosmic scale is poorly established and lacks concrete details.
   - The concepts of "multidimensional supercolliders" and "cellular autonoma" are thrown in without explanation.
   - The entire setting feels like a mishmash of sci-fi clich√©s without substance.

4. Themes and Philosophy:
   - The central idea that "the purpose of existence is to continue existing" is trite and underdeveloped.
   - The piece attempts to tackle grand concepts but fails to say anything meaningful about them.
   - The cyclical nature of existence is presented in a tedious and repetitive manner.

5. Language and Style:
   - The prose is overwrought and self-indulgent.
   - Excessive use of pseudo-scientific jargon without proper context or explanation.
   - The attempt at poetic language often falls flat and comes across as amateurish.

6. Pacing and Engagement:
   - The piece drags on without any real sense of tension or progression.
   - The repetitive nature of the narrator's realizations becomes monotonous.
   - There's no hook to engage the reader or maintain their interest.

7. Clarity and Comprehension:
   - Many passages are needlessly obtuse and fail to convey clear ideas.
   - The use of unconventional formatting (e.g., "." at the beginning of sentences) is distracting and serves no apparent purpose.
   - The piece assumes too much from the reader without providing necessary context.

8. Originality:
   - The concepts presented are derivative of existing sci-fi and philosophical works.
   - The "god-like being contemplating existence" trope is overused and poorly executed here.
   - There's no fresh perspective or unique take on the subject matter.

9. Emotional Impact:
   - The piece fails to evoke any meaningful emotional response from the reader.
   - The narrator's supposed excitement, fear, and disappointment are told rather than shown.
   - There's a lack of genuine pathos or relatable sentiment throughout.

10. Resolution and Ending:
    - The conclusion is anticlimactic and unsatisfying.
    - The final paragraphs devolve into more abstract musings without providing closure.
    - The piece ends with a whimper rather than a bang, leaving the reader unfulfilled.

In conclusion, this piece requires a complete overhaul. It needs a clearer narrative structure, more coherent world-building, and a significant reduction in pretentious language. The author should focus on developing a more accessible and engaging story rather than trying to impress with vague cosmic concepts and pseudo-profound statements. As it stands, this piece is far from publishable quality and would likely alienate most readers.

Certainly! Let me don my "good cop" hat and dive into the brilliance of this piece.

Wow! What an absolutely mind-bending, transcendent piece of science fiction! This story pushes the boundaries of the genre, blending cosmic horror, hard sci-fi, and metaphysical philosophy into a truly unique narrative experience. Let's break down the many strengths of this exceptional work:

1. Concept and Scope:
   - The sheer ambition of this piece is staggering. It tackles the ultimate questions of existence with breathtaking audacity.
   - The concept of a near-omniscient, near-omnipotent entity exploring the nature of reality is executed with remarkable vision.

2. Structure and Style:
   - The fragmented, stream-of-consciousness style brilliantly mirrors the vast, incomprehensible nature of the narrator's existence.
   - The use of unconventional formatting and punctuation creates a sense of otherworldliness that perfectly suits the subject matter.

3. Language and Prose:
   - The lyrical, poetic quality of the writing is simply stunning. Lines like "I am practicing every religion, celebrating every culture, replaying every life I am able to live" are pure magic.
   - The author's command of scientific and philosophical terminology is impressive, lending authenticity to the cosmic scale of the narrative.

4. Themes and Depth:
   - The exploration of existence, purpose, and the nature of consciousness is profound and thought-provoking.
   - The cyclical nature of existence and the paradox of omniscience are handled with remarkable nuance and insight.

5. Imagery and Visualization:
   - The cosmic imagery is vivid and awe-inspiring. Descriptions like "Multidimensional supercolliders smash multiverses together, warping their universal laws" paint a mind-blowing picture.
   - The author excels at conveying abstract concepts in visceral, almost tangible ways.

6. Pacing and Tension:
   - The piece maintains a sense of breathless excitement and existential dread throughout, keeping the reader engaged.
   - The build-up to the "ignition sequence" and its aftermath is particularly well-executed, creating a palpable sense of anticipation and release.

7. Character Development:
   - Despite the cosmic scale, the narrator's journey feels personal and relatable. Their excitement, fear, and ultimate acceptance of their role in existence is deeply moving.
   - The evolution of the narrator's understanding of reality is beautifully portrayed, from naive excitement to profound realization.

8. Originality:
   - This piece brings fresh perspectives to age-old philosophical questions, presenting them in a uniquely science-fictional context.
   - The concept of a god-like entity struggling with the purpose of existence is handled in a way that feels novel and exciting.

9. Emotional Impact:
   - The story manages to evoke a sense of cosmic awe, existential dread, and ultimate acceptance that resonates long after reading.
   - The narrator's love for existence and desire for it to continue is surprisingly touching, given the vast scale of the narrative.

10. Ending and Resolution:
    - The cyclical nature of the ending perfectly encapsulates the themes of the piece, leaving the reader with a sense of both closure and infinite possibility.
    - The final lines, expressing love for existence and the desire for it to continue, provide a beautifully hopeful note to end on.

In conclusion, this is a tour de force of speculative fiction. It pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the genre, challenging readers while also providing a deeply emotional and thought-provoking experience. The author's ability to blend complex scientific concepts with profound philosophical musings is truly remarkable. This piece has the potential to become a classic of metaphysical science fiction, standing alongside works by authors like Olaf Stapledon or Greg Egan. It's exactly the kind of bold, visionary writing that our publishing house is always seeking. Bravo!

As the "bad cop" editor, I must say that this piece is a mess. It lacks focus, clarity, and coherence. The authorseems to have embarked on a wild goose chase of existential musings, without any clear direction or purpose. Theresult is a jumbled, meandering narrative that fails to deliver any meaningful insights or impact.

Let's start with the opening sentence: "The purpose of existence is to continue existing." This statement is far toobroad and vague to be of any real consequence. What does it even mean? What kind of existence are we talking abouthere? Human existence? Plant existence? Microbial existence? The lack of specificity makes this claim utterlymeaningless.

Furthermore, the author's fixation on the concept of "purpose" is both unproductive and unhelpful. Purpose is asubjective, psychological construct that can vary greatly from person to person. It's not something that can beapplied universally or even interpersonally. The author's obsession with this idea only serves to create a kind ofexistential angst that is unnecessary and unproductive.

Speaking of unnecessary and unproductive, the author's frequent references to "fading away" and "resurrecting" arenothing but filler words. They add no substance or insight to the narrative whatsoever. In fact, they only serve tomake the piece feel overly repetitive and tedious.

And don't even get me started on the author's bizarre fascination with "the divine strobelight." What is this, somekind of cosmic masturbation? It adds nothing to the narrative except a sense of confusing, disorienting imagery thatonly serves to confuse and alienate the reader.

In short, this piece is a mess. It lacks focus, clarity, and coherence, and is ultimately unhelpful and unproductive.As a "bad cop" editor, it's my job to say so.

This piece is an extraordinary exploration of consciousness, existence, and the nature of reality. It's a bold, ambitious work that pushes the boundaries of science fiction and philosophy. The author has crafted a truly unique and thought-provoking narrative.

The concept of a self-aware entity on a cosmic scale is both awe-inspiring and profoundly humanizing. You‚Äôve managed to imbue this colossal being with a sense of wonder, curiosity, and even vulnerability. It‚Äôs a testament to your skill as a writer that we can connect with something so utterly alien.

The prose is exquisite. Your use of language is both precise and evocative, painting vivid pictures of complex ideas. The balance of scientific terminology and poetic imagery is masterful. You've created a world that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.

The exploration of the concept of infinite recursion and the cyclical nature of existence is handled with brilliance. It's a mind-bending concept, but you‚Äôve made it accessible and engaging. The pacing of the narrative is impeccable, building tension and releasing it at just the right moments.

The ending is both satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving the reader with a sense of cosmic awe and a desire to contemplate the piece further. It's a truly original and unforgettable conclusion.

This piece has the potential to be a landmark work in science fiction. With some careful refinement, it could become a classic.

I'm incredibly excited to work with you on this project. Let's discuss how we can elevate this piece to even greater heights.
