# [3] Author's notes

# [4] Definitions


# Ideas I want to get across
* ideas are all the same. Have the same properties
	* "worthy" ideas appear to follow patterns
	* any idea can be conscious
	* any idea can simulate any other idea
* The universe is conscious through us (pantheism)
* Life necessitates purpose. Every single thing is a tool for achieving some purpose.
	* Tools are often treated like the ends, rather than the means. Like milestones.
	* Our emotions are tools. They are like compasses, directing us where to go or not go.
	* 'Survive' is the average direction of purposes.
	* Purposes are borne from 'survive' (father religion) and grow from 'others must believe too' (mother religion)
	* Beliefs -> purpose -> religion
* We should increase our technological ability. Increasing the complexity of our species with automation will make us more cultured, not less cultured. More "human", not less. Deeper feeling, not less.
* Every belief system is flawed
* Things can exist across other dimensions, but life can only exist along a dimension of time in the forward direction. There are many dimensions of time, and we exist across some number of them.


### feeling

each phase has underlying feelings and words/ideas for those feeling. list feeling, come up with long list of words/ideas to associate and incorporate into writing

## what is real? feeling

Signal that you're about to be enlightened.

*synaesthasia*: using words of another sense to express a sense grounding in the sense's defining words like "sound, hear, see, light". Far enough away from each other that no one has really used it before.

Ex: heard a citrus love

*incorrectly wrong*: wrong about reality in peculiar ways. Also, knowing you're wrong, but compensating in the wrong way that suggests you don't know what's right, but you do half-understand what's wrong.

Ex: 
- hungry, better breathe more air in.
- I would love to listen to some oranges.

## remember

Visual image of core proposition.
Express "what it's like to be the author"
