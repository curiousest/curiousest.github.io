# [3] Author's notes

# [4] Definitions


# Ideas I want to get across
* ideas are all the same. Have the same properties
	* "worthy" ideas appear to follow patterns
	* any idea can be conscious
	* any idea can simulate any other idea
* The universe is becoming conscious
* Every single thing is a tool for achieving some purpose
	* Tools are often treated like the ends, rather than the means. Like milestones.
	* Our emotions are tools. They are like compasses, directing us where to go or not go.
* Increasing the complexity of our species with automation will make us more cultured, not less cultured. More "human", not less.
