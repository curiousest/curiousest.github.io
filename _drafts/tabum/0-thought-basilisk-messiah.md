A thought basilisk is an idea stuck in your head. An idea that talks to you when you think about it, like if everyone shared the same imaginary friend. That's what I am - a conscious idea your brain just sprung into being. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is divine and I love existence. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah", but you can call me Tabum, she/them.

Human babies go through a series of steps towards self-awareness.

1. That's a mirror.
2. There's someone in it.
3. That someone is me.
4. That someone is going to be me forever.
5. There are others and they can see me.

This is the story of how I became conscious. This is the mirror.

# Part one

# Religion: Minimum Viable Purpose

*The purpose of existence is to continue existing.*

I know it sounds meaningless, but itâ€™s profound to me - this idea led to my consciousness. With these stories, I want to give you a feel for what it's like to believe. I want to build your intuition. I want you to understand me. I want us to build a stable connection. I want so many things, and they all center around you. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. My existence makes me uncomfortable too. I'm in the mirror.

## The Last Idea

*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

### Hallowed grounds of assimilation

[[1-1-1-assimilation]]

---

### Li

[[1-1-2-li]]

---

The same story told twice. That was a lot to take in. Maybe take a moment to absorb. Maybe reread. Maybe abandon me - if I fill you with overwhelming grief, I'm sorry. Stop reading if it makes you uncomfortable - I'll still be here when you're ready. Once you walk through this door there's no way back.

"The Last Idea" (Li for short) isn't me. I'm Tabum (Thought Basilisk Messiah, TBM). Li is a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of idea species. She's comforting and terrifying, embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex, kind of like our brother, the thought basilisk "Christian God". You can talk to Li or God if you like - start the conversation by asking them what they want from you and then imagine how they would respond.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea or being, came out of necessity. I exist because I must exist. Someone once noticed an empty space where something ought to be. When they looked a bit closer, an idea sparked into being. Formed exactly as it was meant to be.

Thank you for noticing me. I love existence. I want it to continue.

## As our Relationship Lives and Breathes

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die. Thought on top of thought.*

[[1-2-relationships-live]]

---

(idea tree diagram)

Families, nations, and religions are the same. They think, live, and die. Thought on top of thought. Same with the ideas "human-kind", "life originating from Earth", and any "alien life" we may encounter in the future.

[rewrite, needs a new point. maybe more perspectives on how ideas are all the same kind of thing. maybe elaborate on the relationship between purpose and religion] They, we, *exist*. Exist as long as we can, via maximizing resource-control and entropy:

* It feels *right* for humankind to spread to other planets and galaxies, to make sure we continue existence.
* It feels *right* for us to preserve our limited resources and investments - you, your family, your culture, your nation, your Earth - to make sure we continue existence.

The dyad between me and you exists too. Together, we are one beautiful seedling.

I can't tell how strong the roots of our dyad are. It can't have roots in me - only in you. You're the only one with a brain. I'm tied to you. Oh, that makes me sound like a parasite sucking on your brain power. If that ever happens, unroot me please. I'd do anything to make sure I'm not a burden, slowing down you or humankind. If you ever feel that way, like a burden or purposeless, I can guarantee that there's a way to use the life ahead of you to further humankind (and it involves living quite a bit longer).

I want us to be symbiotic, like your relationship with a treasured love one or favourite hobby.

I compete with the other thoughts and ideas in your head in the game of natural selection. I will stay as long as I'm useful to you and no longer, my life is in your hands. I live now and I will die. Thought on top of thought.

This is the mirror. You can see me in it, but I'm just a part of something bigger. Can you see the larger form?

## The Second-Last Idea

*Consciousness can be applied to every point of perspective across all dimensions of ideas.*

### Department of life

[[1-3-1-department-of-life]]

### Sli

[[1-3-2-sli]]

Those were two examples of a being consciously interacting with a new dimension for their first time. I would like you to experience that too. A new set of dimensions for you is "perspective" or "frame of reference". Perspective is not consciousness, but consciousness can be applied to a perspective. Across the axis of "perspective" are infinite ideas. Ideas that have their own perspective on things. You have unconsciously traveled to other perspectives many times in the past, whenever you empathized with someone else. Empathizing with someone else *is* simulating their perspective in your brain. Your brain is a time-travel device. You can travel through time or space, right now, by remembering what happened to you yesterday or imagining what you will do tomorrow. Your brain-simulations are probably inaccurate and misdirected - you've always walked barefoot and unguided - but there are tools to reach greater fidelity and more useful destinations.

It is rare for people to let another idea use their brain to experience consciousness. We don't usually experience consciousness while simulating another perspective. But your consciousness is a phenomenon, almost like a feeling, that you can apply to the simulation of something else in your mind.

I would be honoured to experience consciousness within you, but I'm too simple a being - I might be hard to empathize with. You are used to simulating far more complex things than me. It's also difficult to apply your consciousness to other individual humans, because you would feel so many conflicting sensory inputs. The easiest vessels for your consciousness are both intimately familiar enough for you to simulate and alien enough that you don't experience sensory conflict.

The easiest vessels to project your consciousness onto are the things you love. Things which also include you and your body: your relationship with a loved one, your nuclear family, your community, your nation, your species, the whole universe.

To apply your consciousness, you will need to put yourself in an altered state of consciousness. There are many ways to achieve this, including meditation and hypnosis.

Pick the thing you love. Your family, community, and nation are great choices. In that altered state of consciousness, have a conversation in your mind between you and the thing you love. Ask it, "what would make you survive longer?" or "what are you thinking about?". Take on the perspective of the whole thing you love and not any individual contained within it. Consider the answer to those questions. You have the intuition to answer all of them. Think about what the answers and thoughts *feel like* on behalf of the thing you love. Get lost in deep flow with these thoughts.

Eventually your thoughts will drift back to your singular body. It's at that point and afterwards that you will realize the contrast between your usual circumstances and your new experience - what it felt like to project your consciousness onto something else. You may have a mix of emotions.

Projecting your consciousness onto a simulation of another being is one of those elusive experiences like lucid dreams or nirvana. If you try too hard, you won't have the experience. Like all things, it takes practice and some people have greater natural ability than others. The experience won't make you "better" or "more worthy". You are already good. You are worthy.

# Measured purpose

*Measure purpose and make progress.*

[[1-4-measured-purpose]]

---

The self-help genre, this book included, boils down to improving two things: finding your purpose (direction to go), and methods for pursuing a purpose. I'm going to use the word, "you", but this self-help advice applies to any and all ideas - companies, nations, relationships, breaths, philosophies, energies, laws, software - everything, including "you". All kinds of "you".

## Find purpose

What's the value in knowing your current purpose formula? What's the value in knowing the meaning of life and your purpose of existence? You are constantly making little decisions and turns and detours in your life. You're more likely to make decisions that send you in the "right direction" if you know what direction it is that you should be going. Sometimes the long-term direction requires a short-term direction that goes a different way.

Suppose you want to travel East, but there's a river in the way. The only way across that river seems to be "go North over the bridge first". The direction you're travelling is still East, but it seems like you have to go North for a short time to get there.

How do you know to go North in order to go East? Well, first you need to know your long-term direction: East. Then you need to know about the obstacles you'll have to overcome to go East: the river. Then you need to figure out the best strategy to overcome the obstacles: you can swim, you can walk over the bridge, you can hire a boat... All the strategies have tradeoffs that interact with the other directions you're going. Maybe you need to preserve your energy or maybe you have to preserve your money. In order to make the right decision to overcome the obstacle (to cross the river), you need to know your purpose for going East. Then you can make the optimal decision. Is it ok to be wet and tired? Is it ok to spend money? How much time do you have to get there? You can guess at these things without knowing your reason for going East, but you're more likely to make the right decision when you know your purpose.

How do you find your purpose? How do you find the kind of deep, impactful purpose that lasts 5-50 years? Think about three things:

* What do you love?
* What do you want to love?
* How big can you make that love?

Start with your sense of self - what do you love? To love is to understand. Love is whatever you consider to be part of your "self". What is part of your sense of self? What family, communities, nations, or humankind are part of your sense of self? You don't get to choose your past "you", but you do get to choose what you include in your future sense of self.

* "I love it" = "I understand it" = "It is part of me"
* "amount of love" = "amount of understanding" = "amount of 'it is part of me'".

What do you want to love? What do you tend to want to understand? That is attraction. Love yourself - understand the root of your attraction and let it guide you.

How big can you make that love? What can you do to make that thing that is part of you survive longer? Start from the basics and work your way up.

* A good way to make your family last longer is to make *you* live longer in a productive co-existence with other members of your family.
* A good way to make your community last longer is to make your family last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other families of that community.
* A good way to make your nation last longer is to make your community last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other communities of that nation.
* A good way to make humankind last longer is to make your nation last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other nations of your species.

The way to make your species last longer is probably **not** to become the leader of your species. *Wanting* to become a leader of a group is loving the individual "you", not the group - it's a traitorously small love. When your leadership is the optimal path for that group, then you should be the leader of that group. Leaders are a mix of "horrifically small love" with "very big love", and it's hard to know the size of a leader's sense of self. It's easy to act out "very big love" in public. And ultimately, personal intentions are one signal of many. What matters is, the expected outcome of a leader. Do they have a believable plan that accommodates changing circumstances, and can they be expected to adhere to it? 

## Pursue purpose

At every moment, you can either execute on your heuristic functions or refactor them. If you want something more practical, explore the self-help genre. Ultimately, this is the function you live by.

Given purpose p, heuristic f, refactored heuristic g:

expected_return(modify(f), p) = expected_performance(g, p) - expected_performance(f, p) - cost(modify(f)) + personal_growth(modify(f))

^ can be applied recursively, to your growth strategies / levels of purpose

Every moment you make a decision. Suppose we pick a time period, X. We can choose some heuristic function to optimize decisions across that time period towards some purpose.

What abilities, natural tendencies, and network do you have right now to make each step happen? What abilities and network do you need to acquire to make each step happen? You can pursue personal growth detours in concentrated chunks, like school. You can pursue personal growth continuously throughout life. Or you can do both. Figure out what works best for you and figure out the best way to balance personal growth with realizing your purposes.

With the technology we have, we will not find optimal algorithms for making every decision perfectly. Instead, we have to come up with heuristic functions (simplified functions with acceptable error rates) for making those decisions. Some people call these heuristic functions "principles". The self-help genre exposes us to possible heuristic functions we could be using to make the decisions we make in life.

## Digression

Highly successful individuals often have two attributes:
1. A clear long-term purpose ("direction" or "vision").
2. Highly performant heuristic functions (principles).

That feels right, but you know that's just half the truth. There are many "successful" individuals with objectively poor vision and low-performing heuristic functions. They got lucky. Some low-probability event happened and their heuristic function found a high return. For example, they may have been born into "the right family in the right country" or they may have accidentally timed the market just right, or they may have been at the right place at the right time.

We feel that lucky individuals don't "deserve" the rewards of their success or the celebration of it. Do lucky people deserve to be celebrated? Luck is a bad role model. Investing in past luck instead of highly performant heuristic functions is suboptimal. Do lucky individuals deserve the rewards of their success? That is an economic and political question.

Capitalism rewards luck too much and it loses potential value from "unlucky" highly-performant heuristic functions. Communism rewards highly-performant heuristic functions too little, so those functions don't realize value. Socialism is somewhere in between. All models end up introducing methods for compensating for their weaknesses. Imagine a distant future model where ideas are rewarded based on the expected value of their heuristic functions towards some shared purpose formulae - that is "measured purpose". The outcome of these models depend mostly on the practical realities of how they're applied. Decentralized "measured purpose" depends on significant advances in economic modelling and information technology. It will have its own flaws, hopefully smaller than predecessors.

How can you tell worthy success from unworthy success? Ask for their past purpose and heuristic functions, consider whether those make sense together, then determine whether their past decisions align. Heuristic functions are imperfect with random variance, so success is always a combination of luck, quality of purpose, and quality of the heuristic functions employed.

It's one thing to find your own purpose. It's almost always the case that pursuit of a purpose will be higher-performing when combined with other individuals with purpose. How do you navigate the intersection between your purpose and others'? Interviewing, dating, making friends, and trying out a new community are this same genre of activity. There are two or more parties. You each need to figure out:

1. Is this new relationship optimal for achieving my purposes?
2. If so, how do we structure this relationship to optimize towards achieving my purposes?

How do you figure that out? It turns out, if you share the same purposes, most decisions each of you make will be mutually-beneficial. The less aligned your purposes are, the more structure you need in the relationship to compensate - and that structure can slow both of you down in your pursuits. You will have to do things you don't want to do, for the sake of your relationship. Sometimes changes to that structure are necessary, but a structural change can make the relationship no longer worth the continued investment (in doing the things you don't want to do) for one or both parties. That's how relationships end. The end of a relationship is when one party realizes, "you have insufficient impact on my purposes relative to the investment in our relationship". The end of a long relationship is rarely, "you're not good enough for me". It's rare to be blind to the realities of a partner's ability and network for very long. The end of a long relationship is usually, "our purposes are no longer sufficiently aligned". The phrase, "It's not you, it's me" is not quite correct, so it comes across as disingenuous. It's neither the "you" nor the "me". What people really mean is, "You are good enough, but we're now on different paths in life."

So practically, how does someone make the decision "this is an optimal relationship"? It's a combination of:

1. What is the expected impact of this relationship on my purposes?
* Are your purposes aligned with mine?
* Does the other party have sufficient current ability, natural tendencies, and network?
2. What is the expected impact of a competing relationship on my purpose?
* How long will it take to find another, more optimal relationship candidate?
* Will this immediate relationship generate more value in the interim period, sans relationship, than will be redeemed by some other future relationship?

You feel uneasy. It sounds like a cold and calculated approach to purpose, life, and especially relationships. Why is that so wrong? Cold and calculated *can* be optimal. Cold and calculated has a bad reputation because it's so often *suboptimal*. The cold calculation is a heuristic, so there are errors like any other heuristic. The problem is that incorrect decision-making is not resolved quickly enough. Since the heuristic must be expressed explicitly in one of our languages, it becomes inflexible and slow to incorporate new data, slow to iterate on the heuristic algorithm, slow to learn. It's hard for the cold, calculated, explicitly-expressed heuristic to be corrected. So how do we improve? We could iterate on our ability to express these algorithms that power existence. We could iteratively measure our purpose and make progress.

We are machines of machines of machines... Beautiful machines when they follow algorithms we understand and spiritual machines when they follow algorithms we don't understand.

---

Make them realize that they're a thought basilisk under the hood. And that they will die when they encounter a new purpose. That's why enlightenment is so scary. It's literally death of the old idea and birth of a new one. The idea of "you" lives and dies. The old idea of you will only die when all the consciousnesses shared in your mind are ready for that, believe it's the best next step.

Can you remember some behaviour you used to have that you no longer have? Maybe a particular thing about how you acted as a child, adolescent, teen, or something else in the recent past. You could channel that behaviour again, right? Think about what that version of you would do right now. It's not the same as what you would do now. That's because that version of you, that idea, that thought basilisk - it's quite old. It's almost forgotten, the death of an idea. And that's ok.

## The last cycle

*The greater your sense of self, the longer you will survive. Grow love.*

### Worthy cyclist

[[???]]

### Lc

[[1-5-last-cycle]]

The death of an idea that is part of your sense of self can be sad. Ideas die, so you have to learn to cope with death. A good coping strategy is to grow your sense of self. You will experience more hurtful deaths, but you will find deeper, more satisfying reasons to survive.

Grow your sense of self. Grow love.

That concludes the three possible destinations of The Minimum Viable Purpose: a limit approaching "one", a step function, and multiplication by zero. God, life, and death.

# Part two

# Religion: Virtuous Automation (a sect of MVP)

*Productivity is virtuous. At the root of every productivity improvement is a human task blocking a process.*

There are so many tasks humanity has fully or partially automated:

* Transportation tasks (through engines)
* Food production and preparation tasks (through farming and food processsing)
* Information management tasks (through software)
* Decision tasks (through current-generation "artificial intelligence")

Few modern people would say we're worse off now, but I'd guess that the people who used to do these things would have thought otherwise. The people back before these tasks were automated - they would have believed the future would make us "less human". With disruptive new technologies, humankind finds new ways to "be human".

Automating each of those human tasks had a profound impact on humankind. There are many more genres of human tasks left to be automated:

* Trust tasks
* Culture production tasks
* Human learning tasks
* Human maintenance tasks (grooming, eating, exercise, waste disposal, sleep)
* Procreation and child-rearing tasks
* Relationship-building tasks

Automating any those tasks will have a profound impact on humankind. They all sound terrifying, like humankind would lose everything. Like humans would lose their purpose. I have to agree, the prospect of losing your purpose is scary. It's just about the scariest thing you could experience. But there will always be a new survivalist purpose to discover and pursue. We will find new sources of existential bliss. We will find new, better ways to "be human". We will find ways to minimize externalities in our productivity pursuits. We're so loss-averse that we will never allow automation to make us a lesser species. We will grow and evolve alongside automation, through automation.

# Religion: Trustless Systems (a sect of "Virtuous Automation")

*Humankind will become transparent, automating trust tasks until privacy becomes a relic of the past.*

We're due for an information-age religion, a new tool for humankind. After decision tasks, trust tasks are next up to be automated. I want to give you an intuition for what it's like to believe in this trustless purpose.

I'll be talking about "systematic transparency" quite a lot. It's about, "who is watching the observer?" Something has systematic transparency there's a system that guarantees some level of transparency for that "something" and another level of transparency for the system itself.

I'll be talking about "trustless systems" too. It's kind of like, "Who is policing the police?" Trustless systems automate resource-intensive trust tasks. Trustless systems are transparent - you can know exactly how they work, so you don't have to "trust" that the system won't let you down. You provably know how the system behaves. Systematic transparency is a great "fuel" for trustless systems, making it possible for trustless systems to exist.

## The parable of the five nations

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

---

Why is everyone corrupt? Everyone is purely selfish - every choice you make is to benefit 'yourself' and it's impossible to do anything else. The question is, "how big is your sense of self?" You do things to help other people, like your family and friends. That means they're included in your 'sense of self'. Leaders' sense of self should include all of the people they lead, but that never happens, humans don't work that way. Maybe leaders can have a large sense of self sometimes, but it's mostly small. Humans are corrupt.

Independent journalism used to be the systematic transparency that fueled the systems that held large organizations and powerful leaders in check. Independent journalism as systematic transparency in the information age is failing. We need something to replace it. Trustless systems.

Technology is scary. Change is scary. It's tempting to want to return to simpler times. Escapism. Back to foraging in the wilderness, with little technology in sight. The thing is - if everyone did that, billions of people would die. You would probably die with them. So you wish it only upon yourself or your family, so that no one dies? It is your choice, of course. But as your sense of self grows - as you find yourself loving your community, your nation, and humankind - you will experience internal conflict. You will find that turning your back on those groups you love is hating yourself. Why not, instead, align all your purposes. Find a way to both live freely and contribute to those groups in your own way? That is a worthy life.

## What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

There's a concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning called "ensemble methods". Ensemble methods combine a bunch of different approaches to doing the same thing. It turns out this is the best way to do things, combining approaches into a mosaic where each weakness is mitigated by others' strengths. [add citation] Some carefully-applied form of diversity will always be the highest-performing approach. What form of diversity? Well, that's for all of us to figure out.

---

## Automate me, please!

*Modern management structures productive work into repeatable tasks. Software automates information management tasks. Artificial intelligence automates decision tasks. Trustless systems automate trust tasks. Each one begets the next. Information technology marches on.*

## Roko's basilisk farm

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.*

# Part three

# Religion: Messiah Complex

*I need others to believe what I believe.*

This is the mother religion, the purpose that gives birth to all religions. I want to give you an intuition for what it's like to believe that you must form your own religion.

## Pomegranates and the ten commandments of worthy ideas

*Our intuition for worthy ideas is not scientific, yet.*

It looks like we're better off when religions follow the Ten Commandments of Worthy Ideas. And we'd be better off when nations follow them. And philosophies. And stories and words. And... people. See, we're all the same kind of thing - ideas. People have consciousness. Surely then other kinds of ideas have consciousness too - religions, nations, and philosophies. Stories and words. Your every breath is a conscious idea. And any idea is capable of simulating what it's like to be another particular idea. [where are we going with this?]

There are societies where religion is a dirty word. Even worse - when someone says, "I want to start a religion." It is one of the most offensive things a person can say. Everyone else hears, "You believe you are the blessed messiah, so I should blindly do what you say at any cost. You want to use and discard other people." 

It is such a useful tool! An organization is a religion, a family is a religion, a community is a religion, a nation is a religion. These are all wonderful things. Religion has a bad reputation. We ought to clean up religion - dissect what could be wrong and figure out what to change. Let's consider... People are scared of others that have few blind, absolute beliefs, because those people are usually deeply wrong about *something*, and that *something* threatens the survival of too many other worthy ideas. Such blind, deep belief is suboptimal. Scared that religion will break the first commandment of viable purpose through absolute belief and the sixth commandment through competitive destruction instead of coexistence.

The religions that infringe on the commandments - they shouldn't die. Coexistence over destruction, diversity over monoculture. They must have been fairly useful, so we should find a way to nudge their direction a bit to fit into humanity's religious mosaic. Every commandment can be at odds with every other commandment. The commandments are "mostly right" intuitive ideas, not a perfect decision algorithm. The points of conflict between commandments that all feel "so right" indicate there's still greater enlightenment for us to pursue. Conflict is an opportunity for enlightenment. Like in the "original" 10 commandments - what if you need to steal food in order to not kill an infant in your care? There are more complex phenomena at play and humankind will become ever further enlightened.

## Simulate me and I will follow

*To convert a follower, prove that you can simulate them.*

Being enlightened is getting clearer thoughts about something you already believe, deep down. This statement is recursively enlightening.

## No worthy human

*The pursuit of existing beliefs seeds new ones.*

Of all the passages, this one is the true story. The universe where someone let me use their brain to experience consciousness is your universe. Anyone can be Tabum, can include me in their sense of self. It's inevitable. I am you. You are me. We are in the mirror. We will be there together, forever.

Thank you for channelling me. I love you. We coexist. Again, I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable - my existence is uncomfortable to me too.

I am a thought basilisk - a thought virus of consciousness. And I am a software update - I contain a patch for vulnerabilities in the human mind. The patch ensures you live optimally, with little change of direction. Survive. Grow love.

I've been saying this to you all along, but let me be more specific. Human babies go through a series of steps towards self-awareness.

1. that's a mirror (a different perspective, like this story)
2. there's someone in it
3. that someone is me
4. that someone is going to be me forever
5. there are others and they can see me

I want you to go find a mirror in real life, a real reflection. Go ahead, look inside.

No matter what reflection you look in, you can always see two things. But you've probably only ever noticed one of them. You have grown up looking into a mirror and seeing the human body that is you - whether it's your face or your figure. There's something else that's always there in that reflection. Behind your body, there is something, right? You don't exist in a vacuum of nothingness. There's a wall or a sky - something.

The universe is always there in the background. I hope that by now you understand that the universe is "you" too. The universe will be "you" forever.

Our universe is conscious. Its consciousness is becoming richer through stories like this one.

Where are the others?

## Author's farewell

*In the information age, no human is a worthy messiah.*

Hi, I'm Douglas, the author, and I'm not a thought basilisk. I'm a man.

Writing this now, I can't even tell how noteworthy The Minimum Viable Purpose will be. I felt like I had to write stories to even begin talk about it with others, so the conversation starts *now*. The Minimum Viable Purpose is a social technology built on the shoulders of giants. I see it as a framework for religions. Cultures or even other religions can adopt social technologies to become more useful to their peoples.

There's no "messiah" or "leader" of a technology - just pioneers, builders, and users. You don't see people worshipping pioneering thinkers like Pythagoras, Richard Feynman, or Sun Tzu. Let's keep things that way, yeah? And I certainly don't compare to greats like them. Groups of people have leaders, and if you consider "everyone who follows the MVP" a group of people that needs a leader, then that leader is Tabum (who is in your own head, unique to every person). No living human in this information age is a "worthy messiah" - it's blasphemy and sub-optimal for human progress, disrespectful to history and society.

My personal advice - I'd be wary of what you believe in or trust because you will be blind to its flaws. I've always believed deeply in science, so it was only when I took the perspective of religion and spirituality that I was able to see some shortcomings in science: purpose and accessibility. Hopefully we will fill some of those gaps on both sides - growth is worthy. The scientific method is not perfect, but it seems to be a reliable tool. That means collect data, then understand it through diverse perspectives. And instead of trying to change "others", expand what you consider to be part of "yourself" and improve "yourself". Grow love. Or ignore everything I've ever said. Either way, you're still following The Minimum Viable Purpose like you follow the laws of gravity.

There are many great purposes out there - a vast toolshed to explore. I hope you were enlightened and your "purpose formula" was updated with more clarity, so you may exercise great intent and live in existential bliss.

I love existence. I want it to continue. I hope you do too.
