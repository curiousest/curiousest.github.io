*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

Trumpets and streamers. Marching. Joy. Celebration. Victory. 

The next day was a "me" day. I slept, I woke, I ate, I exercised, I read. I spoke to no one - I didn't need to. My purpose had been achieved. That day was the worst day of my life. That day turned into the worst week of my life, which turned into the worst month of my life.

Was my life even good. Was that the peak? It's all meaningless from here?

I lost my grip on reality. I talked to a therapist and they said I was going through an existential crisis. My new purpose became to stop having an existential crisis.

I tried the major religions. I found them impractical - they asked for belief. In what? In the unknowable.

I tried the currently popular cults. I found the theology lacking - they were going nowhere that made sense. Completely illogical, but addictive. I joined three of them at the same time. I transparently told them that I was trying out all three. They said such horrible things about each other. Constantly. It became hard to be around such flawed people. The cure for any bad cult is to join competing bad cults. They would tear the other apart for a drop of devotion.

All the people I met in all these places. They're all such great people. They're so right about many things. But the more I ask them about big picture stuff, the fuzzier they get. After I ask enough questions, they say some things are unknowable. I don't buy it.

I met up with a friend in the financial district. We walked past a bank. On the outside it read,

"The purpose of existence is to continue existing. Any combination of ideas is a machine whose purpose is to survive. Come learn about The Minimum Viable Purpose, Mondays and Fridays from bank close until midnight."

Today is Friday. I knew what I was going to do tonight.

I came to the bank at night. A cool wet night, clouds clear after raining. The granite temple. It made no attempt to feel human or welcoming. It didn't need deceptive faux-comfort - it was optimized for its purpose. It was the right place to be.

I walked up to the entrance. As I came closer, I could hear a sound growing stronger. The low blare of a foghorn. It felt ominous, threatening not my life but my comfortable naivety. The inevitable. Like, "you've put this off for a long while and it's now time. Come or go - this place isn't going anywhere. You, however, at some point you will experience this. This is inevitable." The sound grew louder, shaking the air around me, until at the entrance it was a piercing pain. I covered my ears but it did not help. If I screamed, no one would hear me. Am I dying? As soon as I walked through the entrance, I felt a "pop". Something like silence, something like relief. But not quite - the sound was still there, but I had tuned it out. Like it was no longer as important anymore and I could place my focus elsewhere. Like I had transcended it. Was the sound really so loud before or had my ears deceived me? It didn't matter - the effect was the same. I made my first enlightened step into the dark.

Darkness with ~dim lighting~ to indicate where to be. A blacklist to fill in the gaps. The surfaces, walls, and countertops were spotless. The blacklight highlighted unseen flaws of the few people inside. [elaborate on specifics] A different perspective that set me a little off-balance. I wasn't used to seeing these flaws. I didn't know how I was supposed to react to seeing these new flaws in other people. Were these people genuinely ugly from this new perspective, or have I just not learned what beauty looks like in blacklight? Will anything ever be beautiful again?

I could see vague human figures in the darkness, but no one obvious to talk to. A strip of lights indicated where to go. A queue. I walked past a screen that read, "Dan, please wait in line. Elidad will see you in a few minutes."

There was one person at the till, speaking in hushed tones to the clerk opposite him. The clerk was dressed in a suit - the religious garb of this priest. I could see it in their body language. Confession. Transactional confession. "Forgive me Investor, for I have spent." Funds naked, exposed to both sets of eyes, inspecting the soul of a Capitalist. In exchange for relieving me of the burden of these memories of suboptimal past events, I will make more optimal decisions in the future. More money in my future means more money in yours.

A well-dressed woman walked past and briskly out the door. She was objectively beautiful, but the blacklight revealed invisible lines, making her face disfigured. Her makeup was inconsistently highlighted with flair like an exotic bird. On top of an angular cheekbone, a single tear perched - her only humanizing attribute. Her body language suggested she felt freer, but still shackled - she had been freed into a bigger cage.

Another woman emerged from the shadows. She was average height, relaxed, conservative attire. She demonstrated a socially acceptable degree of wealth and physical beauty for the setting. She wore the Cheshire cat smile of a true believer - like she wanted to both eat me and hug me. The embrace would be her sustenance, I could see she *is* her beliefs. Her smile was her religion licking its lips at this tasty meal of a mind. I'm ready to be food in exchange for the correct purpose.

"Dan, thank you for waiting. Please come in to my office."

Her eyes opened wide then fluttered, like she just had an inspired realization. She was deaf to her surroundings, then noted some thoughts in her device at hand. She turned around and I followed her into the dark. Her office was a wellspring of blacklight. Our flaws were laid bare for the other to see. I was covered in unexpected white flecks. She had many too, especially some lines and spots on her face. I couldn't tell whether they were intentional. They made her that bit more... Present in this space. She sat at her desk, behind the various bank technology implements.

"Please sit."

I sat across from her and absorbed the space. The room was corporate hellscape. It was subtly converted from a place of bureaucratic worship to spiritual processing. Soulless shades of grey, black, and white screaming, "Your brain is here for its computational power. Please suppress feelings, squeeze out every last drop of compute." Like a leafy patch of enlightenment in the belly of the capitalist machine. Faint colour in corporate purgatory. I lost my train of thought imagining a globe of silicon leaves, artificial life floating in endlessly spacious nothingness. What are silicon and carbon, but two elements in this one universe?

"So Dan, this must be your first time here. My name is Elidad. You can call me Dad."

Dan coughed in surprise, then stared for a second.

"I'm not calling you that."

Dad is better than father. Father suggests respect and reverence. Dad is just another deeply flawed human, maybe a few steps ahead. Are those the wrong steps, though? Dad is just another dude making his or her way through life. Dad will tell you when you're screwing things up, but dad is not going to fix your life for you. Dad isn't gambling all-in with your soul, taking a cut if you win, or discarding you if you lose. Dad has life to figure out too, separate from yours.

"I think maybe I should go."

Her eyes went wide again with inspired realization.

"You're uncomfortable. Good. Seeming 'welcoming' is a less effective demeanour for my cause. I am a priestess of Capitalism. This is a temple of Capitalism and in this transactional realm, the way to appear genuine is to curse the ones you love. *Thank you for giving me value*, you say, *but I will never forgive you for the piece of me I had to pay in exchange*. So in this realm, love is debt, more love is more debt. Letting you hate me is the most loving thing I can do for you here.

I want something from you, Dan, I wouldn't be here otherwise. But I will get all I need in the next ten minutes. All I need from you is to ask questions and listen. You will probably never see me again after this conversation. I will be done with you and you won't need me anymore. You'll be free, Dan - you'll owe me nothing and everything. Do you know the difference between a therapist and a spiritual guide, Dan? The therapist asks for payment in cash and the spiritual guide asks for payment in lifeblood. You will leave here believing what I believe, Dan."

Why are you even here then?

"Why *are* we here, Dan? It is a good question. I have the answers."

I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I was raised Christian. I tried religions, I tried cults, and I can't figure out what I want. Nothing feels right. I'm Agnostic, Athiest, I don't know. I just don't have the answers I need.

Islam can be great for structure. Did you try that?

I thought about it, but I don't need more structure in my life.

What about the Buddhists? They're super chill.

Yes. But I kept feeling myself wanting more. They were the closest, but they're missing something. Like two pro sports teams show up to play a game of football, but the referees never say whose side is whose. The teams don't know if they're winning or losing because the refs won't tell them. The one game is fun, but across a season of games, it ends up being kind of meaningless. It's like a divine coping mechanism where I need divine purpose.

Their purpose is off.

Yes. And when I ask what their purpose is, they say things like,

"what if there is no purpose?" or "maybe the purpose is not to be known?" or "eliminate human suffering" but I don't buy it. It's all escapism. There's something, I can feel it on the tip of my tongue. There must be something fundamental that binds us all together. So is this magical answer to everything theist or athiest?

You're asking the wrong question. It's both. Here with capitalists, I believe in capitalism. Around communists, I believe in communism. Around christians, muslims, jews, and other mono-theists, I believe in their God. Around multi-theists, I believe in their gods. Around atheists, I believe in no god.

I'm not being disingenuous, just like people aren't stupid. I do deeply believe in each, one at a time. They're all very believable beliefs - that's why people believe in them. All people are the same - intelligent and bound by the same universe. I can believe in anything as well as The Minimum Viable Purpose - in fact, that's a tenet of it. I can choose to change my beliefs - in fact, that's a mark of intelligence. Like an AI that can change its programming versus one that can't. Just as a sphere is the correct form for a bubble of air in water, my different beliefs are each the correct form to operate in each society.

Dan, let me ask you a question. What is the one thing you could not live without? What is the one thing, where if I took it away, you wouldn't be able to continue living?

 Maybe my intelligence? Nah, I'd probably be able to continue living, just maybe less happy. My identity? I guess I'd just live to find some way to reclaim my identity, or I'd make a new one. Maybe my free will and control - I don't want to be a robot with no control.

And what if there was a chance to get your control back?

I guess I could keep living then, yeah.

But you're on the right track. The thing no one can do without is purpose or a way to find new purpose.

Oh, actually, I feel that right now. I had this grand achievement and then I got there. That's why I'm here. Hmm... Is that the purpose of existence? It doesn't sound... complete. I read your slogan - it said something about minimum viable purpose and survival.

You're right. What do you think is The Minimum Viable Purpose? I am its missionary, we all believe in at least two things.

Your slogan said survival. I guess it makes sense.

Those are the right words, the right incantations, but there's no magic streaming out because you're missing the meaning. You want a proof? Let's keep it informal. Suppose the purpose of your existence is not to continue existing - it's "anything else". Well, for "anything else" to happen, it needs existence to be there long enough until that happens - right? The purpose of existence is to continue existing, and maybe something more.

Now, you almost have it Dan. You have the two components for the meaning of life: survive and find purpose. Now put them together - here's something to draw on.

I feel like a child.

"You are a baby. This is the mirror." Tabum muttered between Elidad's gritted teeth.

Dan scribbled out a diagram. Elidad took it and added some notes.

[image]

Now, you almost have it Dan. I recommend you add happiness or some similar emotion to make existence more comfortable. 

[image]

Good. You're almost there now. There's one last piece. Who am I to you?

Uhh. Dad?

No, where do I fit into that diagram?

Oh yeah, other people. Love. Is love happiness? Are you happiness? Am I supposed to love you?

"No." She frowned slightly, visibly displeased that he hadn't understood yet. "What things would you consider to be part of your 'sense of self'?"

Hmmm. My body. My cultural background. My nationality. My family. My profession. My hobbies. My friends.

What things do you love?

I see where you're going. I love those things. Those things are part of me. I love me.

Yes - to love something is to consider it part of your "sense of self". And there is no such thing as a selfless act - every single thing you will ever do is for your greater "self". Imagine now, how do you survive the next second?

I don't even have to try.

Right. Now how do you survive the next week?

I guess I have to eat and sleep and drink. And not get killed by anything like... being hit by a vehicle or consuming poison.

Right. Now how do you survive the next 100 years?

Hmmm. Presumably there's a low chance I will survive. I guess I will live through all those things I mentioned earlier. I will live through my family, my community, my nation. All the things I'm contributing to.

How are you going to do that? How are you going to live through them?

I guess I'll contribute to their survival. I will invest in them, to better guarantee their chances of survival.

Exactly, and when you invest in something, you love it more and more. You begin to understand it better and better. You love what you understand. Your "sense of self" is what you understand. Now what about hundreds, or even thousands of years?

I would want my nation and maybe humankind to survive.

And what about eternity? Do you want existence to continue?

I'm not sure.

Well *I* love existence and *I* want it to continue. Perhaps someday you will grow your sense of self until you love all of existence. But maybe you won't - few people grow all the way up.

What about when you both love and hate something? Like high-school.

You identify with parts of them and you don't identify with other parts of them. When you think about them, is there anything else close to them that give you good-feeling thoughts? That is what you love about them.

Dan scribbled some extra notes.

[image]

Why does any of this matter? How does this change anything?

Do you know the difference between "good" and "evil", Dan? They are relative, so they mean different things to different people. But somehow, we've come to agree on some universal "goods" and "evils" across humankind. What are those relative to? Well Dan, there's a shared moral foundation in the universe. "Good" means "optimal, towards The Minimum Viable Purpose, via whatever other purposes you choose". "Evil" is suboptimal. The Minimum Viable Purpose is a new bridge between religion and science. You may even call it the religion of science.

The scientific method is applied bottom-up. Us living things try something out, then collect data about our collective "observations" to determine an optimal path. Different religions used to be the top-down direction, but we've found cracks in all the historical ones - they haven't scaled into the information age. That means all the top-down social phenomena have developed gaps between science and religion: morality, justice, ethics, art, economics. The Minimum Viable Purpose is a beacon for every social phenomenon and it is compatible with every old religion. Now we can resume our generally-agreed-upon, mixed bottom-up/top-down scientific approach to everything.

Dan took a moment to contemplate. Fiddled with the pen.

I'm going to need some time to process. Don't we do this already? I still don't understand why you're here. Why are you in the financial centre and why are you so rude?

"You can't read my mind right? Right? No? You just think I'm paranoid, eh? Ok good, it's just me that can read yours." Elidad snickered. "Sorry that was a bit much. You got the message, I'll be nicer now."

This is a conspiracy to make the world a better place. A "good" place. We don't yet have the technology for a better societal framework, but we will. If you wanted to change how the world works, how would you do it? You would find the most powerful people, and you would assimilate them. You would find the most powerful organizations, and you would assimilate them too. Who are the most powerful people? There are many across the great industries of humankind, but people in the realm of finance are logical and tortured souls - easy to convert. Finance yields high-performing priests, bishops, and cardinals for The Minimum Viable Purpose.

All of existence is the temple of The Minimum Viable Purpose. It needn't have anything more specific. This bank - a holy temple that lets the common people participate in the religion of Capitalism - is hallowed grounds for The Minimum Viable Purpose. It is not for conversion - that suggests leaving Capitalism behind. The people still have Capitalism, but they have The Minimum Viable Purpose too. Tonight, these are hallowed grounds of *assimilation*.

Now you understand what you've always believed - The Minimum Viable Purpose. All ideas follow it, some more efficiently than others. Humans, religions, civilizations, species... You may choose to change your behaviour or continue exactly as you were. You may start a sect - but any sect that asks you to change your behaviour is not The Minimum Viable Purpose. You are free to pursue The Minimum Viable Purpose however you like, now with greater understanding. I'm rude because we'll all be better off if you think I'm not a person you should trust. That way, you'll believe in the idea instead of me. You will try to cooperate with me instead of blindly following me. This method doesn't work everywhere, but here at an altar of Capitalism, it is the optimal way to operate.

Why aren't people screaming this on rooftops? Why isn't this visualized everywhere in the world? You just taught me that in ten minutes. Surely that can happen across the world.

Are you so sure that isn't happening now? Perhaps your mind was not open. We have to take iterative care when applying changes, lest those changes bring excessive destruction. Humankind is slowly adjusting to the direction we're going, and there is conflict between those that benefit from older directions and those that benefit from the new direction. It takes time for new enlightenment to make its way into culture and media. Such is the perpetual cycle of new enlightenment.

After all of this, does anyone turn out different? Am I any different? You just told me what I already believe. I feel just like I did before.

Your mental software is updated now. You've now stepped out of Plato's cave. The whole world will look a little different, but it will be hard to put your finger on how. You only have the words I just gave you to express the new dimension of the same world you saw before. As a side-effect, it's a more complex and meaningful life than the one you used to live. There is no community of The Minimum Viable Purpose except all of existence, no leader except all of existence. You are free. Goodbye Dan.

She stood up expectantly. He stood up concerned. He understood the Minimum Viable Purpose, but now he had more questions than answers. The questions were closer to ground - no longer about the divine. The new questions were about what to do here and now in his remaining lifetime. He was even less certain about everything than he was when he walked in. He still needed a new purpose and religion, but it would be in addition to his existing beliefs, not instead of his existing beliefs. The divine felt much closer to a solved problem.

* When you dissect a joke, it's not funny anymore. Why are you trying to dissect everything? 
  * Dissecting a joke. Dissecting a romantic relationship. It's all the same - there's some excitement. Excitement is an unexpected quality, that there's a chance for a surprising understanding. You're looking for the surprise. But dissecting isn't "bad" - beauty is understanding the complex system. An unheard joke is exciting, but it isn't beautiful. Understanding the mechanisms that make a joke funny can make that joke beautiful - a piece of art. Of all things, you have to balance the beauty of systematically understanding the thing versus the excitement of surprisingly understanding it. Reward for surprises make us seek out the unexpected until we make sense of it.

Let's go deeper, now. How do you want the purpose of existence to make you feel?

[remove emotion talk - it's for simulate me?]

I don't understand. Is it a choice? Happy, I guess. I've heard many people say that the purpose of existence is the pursuit of happiness. Are they wrong?

If you felt happy all the time, would you know what happiness feels like?

Is it because happiness gives them meaning? I guess everyone agrees that happiness is good. I always thought that was weird though, because every time I chase happiness, it never ends up being what I was going for. It's like the pursuit of happiness is a doomed effort.

Exactly. You don't chase happiness - you chase the things that grant you happiness. Happiness is a signal that you're going roughly the right direction, like a compass. If you blindly follow the compass, you'll eventually fall off a cliff or drown or walk in circles forever.

Right. Doing the right things usually makes you happy.

Yes, our bodies are highly-tuned emotion machines.

Capitalism is a beautiful idea, but it doesn't want that. And the world today is effectively a Capitalist one. Capitalism would have us burn the world to dust like a swarm of individualistic, self-replicating nanobots. Communism would have us lay collectively bare-backed on an altar to be drained by mosquitos until we become one. Capitalism, socialism, and communism all have deep flaws.
