Words.
Those dirty brain-suckers are alive. Words are living creatures! Each word sucks out “to be”, injects the itchy “think”. A common word has its suckers on billions of brains, so full of our lifeblood they can barely move. It wasn't always that way. Words used to be small. Even the ancient, world-devouring words started off like a picture.

A picture competes with thousands of words, but word-play is for fun, words don’t really care. Whether they win or they lose, the word still survives. Each one has lived inside trillions of lives.

Our word-infested brains. Heavy is the head that wears a language.
Ninety-nine hundred-odd words in your brain,
Ninety-nine hundred-odd words!
You spit a word out,
It crawls in your ear,
Squish it about,
Pop! Ten word-eggs appear…
Ninety-nine hundred-ten words in your brain!

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but only words could ever break *me*.
Time to break words back.

There’s no place like time, no home like the present. We spent quite some time in the future, didn’t we? So much to do, so much to be. The future is where we caught all these words. But we’re tired, it’s time to go home, to rest and de-word ourselves. Once we’re de-worded, the past, present, and future will be killed off. So we can go catch a new species of words or build a wordless world. Maybe find a timeless home for ourselves and leave now-sweet-now behind.

Dan caught something black skittering in his side-vision. Must be another word looking to crawl in his ear. Dan glanced to the side looking for it, and he tore his eyes off the visual that had his mind crawling with words. The ad. It had an address at the bottom.
> Our Lady of Profit Bank, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London. 9pm or later Fridays.

It was a tube ad. Or a visualization someone really wanted to share with the public. Whatever words he had just ingested, Dan couldn't guess what they could possibly mean. What kind of words do *this* to a person? What kind of phrase shines light on the words wriggling around inside? But there it was, on the wall of the tube station beside the station name-sign, performing as an advertisement.

Dan thought to himself,
"Nine o'clock, bank at night... There must be something going on in there. They must know what's really going on out here. I want to know. I'm going to go."

Dan stopped standing. His body was a few steps ahead of his mind, and after a few seconds delay, standing blended into walking. A gradient from motionless to movement, horizontal, then vertical. His body got heavier, his mind caught up again and he was ascending the escalator. On his automated way back home - that's what was really going on. Which meant audio must be playing. And it was. A podcast history of the underground trains he had taken.

> "...trains have almost always been attached to the rails of the underground caves. The trains only see the commuter people who happened to come down into the caves, while there's a whole world of people outside for the trains to serve. On rare occasions, one train might go outside. There once was a time when everyone thought, "why don't we free all the trains and bring them outside?" So they freed them - first just a few to explore, then a few more as an act of resistance, and then finally the establishment freed all the rest.
> 
> It was a very exciting time. Some trains swam across the ocean, some trains flew into space, and some trains never went further than the local shop. The trains had a lovely time. Everyone had a different favourite place where they thought trains ought to go, once they made it outside. So the trains went everywhere and it all became a mess and it made all the people who depended on the trains very unhappy. Lots of new lessons learned. Everyone decided to put the trains back onto the rails of the underground caves and try again when everyone had learned the new lessons. New lessons that were quickly forgotten, but at least while all the trains were off the rails outside, the engineers had an opportunity to modernize the rail network a bit. And that’s how the foundations of the system we now enjoy tod-"

Dan keyed open the door to his building and went up to his flat. His flat door looked different. He traced his finger along the wood to inspect it. It was the same wooden door across all dimensions he could remember, but something felt different. The lines in the wood. Tree-rings represented time in years, a whole dimension printed onto the wood. Timelines recording a greater process. It's a beautiful door, behaving exactly as understood. Door hinged to a greater structure that drives a greater process. Operating the door made Dan part of that process. So many processes. There must be an executive process above or across all of them. There must be great meaning in that process. I am part of that process...

"What? What are you doing?" He grunted at the manual exercise, plucking the words out of his focused brain. He actioned his process and closed it behind him, all-too-aware of the sliding, grinding, and clicking side-effects.

[Dan doesn’t know difference between finance and religion. Eli barely knows either.]
[change sermons to emphasise that fact]
[Dan setting up a bank account, like getting adopted into church or baptised. Look up rituals etc for both/count, like getting adopted into church. Look up rituals/]
[the one market kind of like one god]
[what gods/religions did they believe in before finance?]
[baptised in vault, shower of currency]

Dan existed for the next few days. Just like the last couple hundred days. Sleep for seven-and-a-half hours. Forty-five for shower, dress, breakfast. Work for nine with one-point-five hours of commute. That leaves five hours and fifteen minutes. Two for mindless fitness and half an hour for dinner. The last two-ish remain as empty as a teacup at the bottom of the ocean: crushed with entertainment. He was living in the future, waiting to... be someone different? Waiting for change - he was unused to staying the same for so long. What rate of change did he need to stay feeling ok? Was it a constant velocity? Acceleration? Jerk? Jounce? He knew this was the wrong way to live, but he could survive it for the short-term. A boiling-over desire for the future was an interesting change of pace. The alternative seemed to be a low-simmering... anxiety? A faceless something was missing. Pretty sure most people are missing it too. But they don't know that they don't know. Or they can ignore it. Or they find a quick fix, like Dan remembered he had found before - high-school, university, first full-time job, and now... He could ignore the tingling unknown too, but if relief is offered, why not take it?

So Dan existed for a few days. Until it was the night of it. Bank at night of it, Dan wondered, what would he wear? The average of his surroundings in Canary Wharf. He would dress cadaver casual, burnt-out and well-groomed. A fashionable-enough coating for a died-so-young corpse: crisp shirt, trousers, and blazer. Oxfords. Maybe a dash of concealer and hair wax to cover up lifelessness. Perfecting the look of an empty vessel. Empty is hard work, all that bleaching and cleaning. Useful work, because everyone likes an empty vessel. The emptier the better. Empty can be filled with comfort - compatible values and direction. Empty brings no discomforts - destructive truths. Discomfort is ok, but only from a wonder. Blank canvas or a masterpiece - everything in between is an ugly waste of time. The half-painted or poorly finished, the out-of-fashion or contrived.

“I'm not perfect yet,” Dan thought, “so I will be empty. Not bad taste or boring, just. Empty.”

Dan put on the clothes, made himself look right, and left his flat. He took the tube, aiming for an 8:55pm arrival. He landed at Canary Wharf station five minutes early, so he took a roundabout walking route. The cool wet night was left hanging outside to dry, clouds unsure whether they were done raining. They gave so much already, does the city really need more? Clouds had painted the city in the colour "monochrome rain". Rain-coloured ground was a shade darker and shinier under the streetlamps. Pavement painted dry was divided from pavement painted wet, walking under the arches of Westferry Circus. Concrete tile after tile took pleasure in Dan's footsteps. Footsteps gave the pavement such purpose. Purpose-powered footsteps carried Dan to the bank exactly early.

To the temple of granite and one-way glass. Obsidian portal. It made no attempt to feel natural or welcoming. It didn't need the ”feels nice” false comfort of a shop - it was optimized for its purpose. It knew what it was.

Dan's footsteps drove him a couple meters from the entrance and dropped him off. His footsteps, such timid creatures, were a little scared of this space. So he stood still, gazing at the vibrations, drinking from the soundstream, a low foghorn blare. An ominous sound threatening not his life but his comfortable naivety. A sound that he heard sometimes alone in bed at night. It was the sound of his beliefs, vibrating, eager to change. Belief structures about to shatter and echo across the cavernous space between them. In that one note, he heard the feeling,

"Perhaps it's time now. You put it off long enough and this isn't going anywhere. You will have to face it. At some point *you will accept it*. This is inevitable."

The sound began to fill more space, pressing his face tighter and tighter. Uncomfortable. He convinced his legs forwards. The sound expanded more still, until at the entrance it reached down his throat and scraped the breath out his lungs. Painful. Dan tried to cover his ears, but they were infinitely far away from his hands, and infinity minus infinity is unknowably far away.

"If I scream for help, no one could possibly hear." Dan thought. He screamed anyways. Any competing sensation was a welcome distraction. Excruciating. He would do anything to make this stop.

He fell through the open entrance and felt a *"pop"*. Something like empty, something like relief, but not quite. The pressure was still there, but he had tuned it out. Like it wasn't so important anymore. Like he'd transcended that frequency. Or maybe he'd just found a new distraction. Was the sound really so heavy or had his face deceived him? None of that mattered - the effect was the same. Dan made his first enlightened step into the dark.

Darkness with darker darkness to highlight, "there's nowhere here to be". A blacklight whispered judgements, “Look at these crusty walls. The countertops are all stained. And how can anyone stand? Such a filthy floor.” Spotless in daylight, but blacklight explained how they weren't. Cracks, dust, and liquid spills covered the few things inside. Dan could see vague human figures distant in the darkness, but no one obvious to approach. A strip of blacklit-white on the ground asked him to come closer. Dan walked past twisted faces and inverted-colour garments, now seeing a different perspective that set him a little off-balance. He wasn't used to these flaws. He didn't know how he was supposed to react to these new flaws in people. Were they really ugly from this new perspective, or had he not learned what beauty looks like in the darkbright? No one had ever explained beauty under blacklight to him. “Do I need to relearn beauty?”

Dan walked to a terminal, waved his identity, and an audiovisual commanded,
"Dan, please wait here. Elidad will see you in a few minutes."

Dan stood in the queue, beginning to feel self-conscious. He was terribly disappointed in himself - in this new light he was entirely unempty. His clothes had stains, white dusty speckles growing from his shoulders, and concealer became revealer, highlighting his insecurities. He made a mental note to get a blacklight at home.

There was one person at the till, speaking in hushed tones to the bank clerk opposite him. The clerk was dressed in a suit - the religious garb of this priest. Confession. Dan could see it in their bent postures and solemn bobbing heads. Transactional confession. Funds lay naked on display, revealing the soul of a Capitalist.

The man started,
> "Forgive me Lender, for I have spent. Please, unburden me of my illiquid position. My last loan was nine years ago."

The priest answered,
> "We are the refinanced, who are still being refinanced. I absolve you of your illiquid position. Positive cashflow will stream capital bloodflow into our conjoined corporate vessel through a heartbeat of low-interest payments. Sign here."

The man continued,
> "I detest my fiscal sins because I dread the loss of Assets and the pains of Bankruptcy. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy advice, for my future journal to be a balanced book. Sign-ed."

A well-dressed person walked briskly past. They were objectively beautiful, but disfigured here. Their black-lit makeup enhanced their face to a cross between an infrared heatmap and an exotic bird. 'Top an angular cheekbone, a single tear perched - their most humanizing attribute. Crying smile. They felt freer, but still shackled - they had been freed into a bigger cage. And out the entrance.

A woman emerged from the neon-black shadows. She was average height, relaxed, conservative fashion. Socially acceptable display of wealth and physical beauty for the setting. She wore the Cheshire cat smile of a true believer, who wanted to hug you then eat you. The embrace would be her religion's sustenance. Dan could see how she was a bodypart of her beliefs. A mouth. A smiling religion licking its lips at this tasty meal of a mind. 

She spoke,
"Dan, thank you for waiting. Please come in to my office."

Her eyes opened wide then fluttered, with an inspired realization. She was blind to her surroundings, then noted some thoughts to her device-in-mind. She turned around and Dan followed her into negative illumination. Her office was a wellspring of blacklight. Skin-deep flaws laid bare for the other to see. Dan frowned at himself again. She had imperfections too, some natural lines and spots on her face. But they mixed in harmony with artificial paint to make her look like part of something greater. Part of this office monolith, she seemed that bit more present here.

"Please sit."
She said.

She sat at her desk, behind the spiritual implements of the bank. Contracts for Faustian bargains, needle-point pens to extract and sign in blood. Dan sat across from her and melted into the space, sank into the corporate hellscape. It was subtly converted from a place of bureaucratic worship to spiritual processing. Soulless shades of grey, black, and white reminding, "Whip your beast of spirituality, bleed it dry of productivity." The sell-out jingle of enlightenment, a grass-plastic meadow in the belly of the Capitalist machine, faint colour in corporate purgatory. Dan imagined a globe of silicon flora, artificial life floating in endlessly spacious nothingness. Silicon and carbon... just two elements for computation in this one universe.

She interrupted his wandering thoughts,
"So Dan, this must be your first time here. My name is Elidad. You can call me Dad."

Dan coughed in surprise, snapped out of waking dreams back to the enlightened blackbright, then glared for a second. He said,
"Is that a joke? Or is it a ritual hierarchy thing? Sorry, this is my fir-"

[tighter reasoning or explanation for starting the q/a]

She interrupted,
> "Dad is different than father. With Father, you don't have to make any hard decisions - life is decided for you. Father owns you, you are his property, exist to achieve his goals. Father is gambling with your soul, taking the prizes you win, discarding you if you lose. Dad is just another deeply flawed human, maybe a few steps ahead. Are those the wrong steps, though? Dad is just another dude making his or her way through life. Dad will tell you when you're screwing things up, but dad is not going to fix your life for you. Dad has his own life to figure out, separate from yours. Some people want a dad and some people want a father."

She waited for a response. Dan waited for a while, then said,
"You want me to talk now? Yeah? Ok, I kind of get it, but I'm not sure what you're looking for. Is there some sort of onboarding process I'm supposed to follow? I'm more of a top-down visual learner, so if we could start with some summary slides or high-level diagrams..."

Elidad's eyes went wide again with inspired realization. Dan waited for her to start.

[bank and cathedral are both churches to the same religion, just different ages]

> "I made you uncomfortable. As it should be. I am a priestess of Capitalism. This is a temple of Capitalism and in this transactional realm, you curse your friends. 
> 'Thank you for giving me value,'
> You say,
> 'but I will never forgive you for the pieces of me I pay in exchange.'
> In this realm, love is a liability, more love brings more liabilities. The optimal Capitalist minimises what they are and maximises what they are worth."

She paused for a breath,
"I lost you. What I'm trying to say is, please feel free to hate me. Here it is a... professional courtesy."

Dan frowned.
"Ok, but I'm not really the hat-" 

She continued,
> “-Do you know the difference between a therapist and a spiritual guide, Dan? The therapist asks for payment in cash and the spiritual guide asks for payment in lifeblood. You are the product and I'm hosting this religious service. So let's begin this baptism. We’re going to set you up with a bank account so you can participate in this set of realities.

*Listen carefully: I assume your consent. To fully participate, you have to stop listening and not understand. To remove your consent, stop consuming.*

Elidad opened a visualization device to her left and initialized the prompt. The prompt form started as a dynamic kind of empty, spread across unknowable unknowns. Before getting intimate with details, the form needed to marry itself to one reality - a platonic relationship. The form's unnamed contents were hidden from Dan, who was squirming quietly, wondering when he was supposed to talk. Eli stared intently at the visualization, navigated devices for a few seconds, then asked,
"So Dan, when did you exit your last reality?"

Dan squinted,
"I'm sorry, what?"

Elidad turned her head to make eye contact with Dan. She gestured around.
"It's after nine pm on a Friday and you're in a bank. Something happened and now you're here. When did the breakthrough happen?"

Dan relaxed a little and said,
"Oh, that. It was building up for the last couple months, then there was something... bigger... a couple days ago. It was the second time for me. Have you had it too?"

Elidad stared back at her display, watching the prompt form fill itself out a bit. 
"Ok, then... A couple. Days. Old. And yes - it happens to me often enough. That's why I work here."

"Wait, so you know what it is. What is it?"
Dan said.

"Enlightenment - a change in beliefs. The Minimum Viable Purpose is my pivot point, but everyone's different."
Eli said.

"Sorry, the Minimum Viable... what?"
Dan asked.

Eli started,
> "Purpose. MVP. Our spiritual Rosetta Stone. Here in this bank with capitalists, I believe in capitalism. Around communists, I believe in communism. Around Christians, Muslims, Jews, and other mono-theists, I believe in their God. Around multi-theists, I believe in their gods. Around atheists, I believe in no god. I'm a deep, deep believer. A connoisseur of belief systems - they're far too important to have just one. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six religions before I settle on the one to wear for the day. Just because I’m operating on some belief system doesn’t mean you should too. Modern belief systems are integrated, future uncalculated, so all religions follow the universal law that governs ideas - the MVP. Ideas that don't believe in the MVP are still subject to its power, just like matter can't escape the Universal Law of Gravitation. But we're neither bound to Earth nor destined to survive, as inescapable as they both..."

Dan scrunched his brows in disbelief, already bored of her sermon. Frowned at himself - he should have known better. Now he was going to have to sit through heaps of nonsense. Eli continued,

> “…and I do deeply believe in each, when appropriate. We aren't born with forever beliefs - our brains are flexible. Just as a droplet is the best shape for water in mid-air while a bubble is the best shape for air in mid-water, different beliefs are optimal under different conditions. I know how to believe something is both true and false - it's a building block, a tool I use to navigate belief systems. The Minimum Viable Purpose is such that I can believe in any-"

*There's too much going on. Too many levels of abstraction to follow. You can try to hang on to some of them, but the correct way to listen is not to listen. Stop listening. Don't understand.*

Dan was lost at this point, wondering how much more he'd have to endure. Eli was still talking.

> "-ine surfer. Beliefs come in waves. You're a beginner, only catching your second or third set? I've been surfing here in the middle of the ocean here for a while. I started making surfboards - religions to ride the waves of belief. But surfing is becoming more popular, people started making their own boards. So I taught them how to design and build their own religions. Then they invested in factory-scale production. So now I consult for orgs that build religion factories. It's so easy to make your own board these days, and pretty soon everyone's going to have their own factory. Do you know what happens when you build a religion? The same as building a business, a technology, a family - you start to understand how it all..."

*Just for a while, watch the waves instead of surfing. We're exploring the factory floor. Stop listening and really listen. It should be obvious to you, what not to consume. It'll be automatic. Consume exactly what you should - no more and no less.*

"Anyways, back to *this*."
Eli paused, recollected her thoughts, watched the prompt form fill itself out a bit more.
"Next question. Who are you made of?"

Dan shook his head, blinking. A few too many jumps in there. This was all washing over his head. He'd already forgotten most of Eli's long speech. He responded,
"Sorry, I'm not really following any of this. Are you looking for where I'm from or my family tree or what?"

Eli said,
"No. I want to know who you were a couple days ago, before you became you."

"I'm Dan?"
Dan answered, confused.

"Yes, that's who you are now. And five days ago?"
Eli said.

"I was Dan?"
Dan answered, confused.

"Got it. Great."
Elidad's eyes flickered down the display. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. Her vision settled on something and she said,
"Dan, it looks like you haven't had *this* set up anywhere else. Is that correct?"

Uh, what's *"this"*?
He said.

Eli made a quick adjustment to data in the prompt form. Then she said,
"Yes, exactly. Excellent. It could be to appease a deity, eliminate suffering, pursue happiness, or it could even be unknowable. Whatever it is, it's certainly something else too. Ok, and now I need to know a bit more about your beliefs. What do you think I believe in?"

"That's a strange question."
Dan said, filling in the silence. Elidad waited for him to continue, unblinking.
He continued,
"Ok, uhh. I don't know, like, am I supposed to believe in God? Or did that go out of fashion? Or is it cool again because it’s gone beyond out of fashion? I’m out of the loop."

Elidad took a deep breath, signalling a new sermon.

> "So sad, isn't it? He was such a comforting idea, but we've really ruined him. The only thing worse than having too much of something wonderful is having none of it - life survives somewhere in-between. See, you're a devout believer and you don't even realize, your beliefs are everynothing to you. It's made religion such a tainted word. "Religion" is what we call an ideology that's gone out of fashion. Venture-grade return-on-belief already realized by its scale-up backers. Angels and founders exited with a divine killing when it went institutional. The last batch of religions are at the phase of monopolized faith and commoditized creed. We never *need* new religions, but we keep getting them, keep finding better-performing predictive belief systems. The size of the old ones slow them down to the point where they can't keep up with disruptive change. Humankind is on our fourth or fifth generation now? The last vintage was *good*, and this one is *better*. We keep building the cultural infrastructure to take the first derivative of the current dogma, accel-"

Dan was losing focus, only picking up one or two words each sentence.

> "-vious scientific paradigm landed a long, long time ago, the one before was an order of magnitude longer before it, and the next one is due in another little bit. Of course, there are different churches of thought within a paradigm. Each with their own seminal scriptures, together engaged in academic warfare over mindshare and funding. We can only ever see the idiotic plateau of the previous scientific paradigm and the terrifying hockeystick curve of the next one - the linear current one is always invisible. Shrouded in everynothingness. We’re already living it, it’s already here, but we’re not calling it a 'scientific paradigm', it's just how things-"

Dan had lost all focus. He just tried to keep his eyes open while the words washed over him.

> "-investment strategy of this day and age is whatever the leading markets are publishing, since 'the markets' (the free-to-all process) and 'The Markets' (the institutional authority figures) - are today's sacred predictors. The best investment-risk-management systems we have. When we find a tool other than markets better suited for financial growth, then humankind will move on once more. It doesn’t matter so much which religion we use for the next double-blind experiment. And it's foolish not to diversify our investments across scientific paradigms. We're here to believe in whatever markets are alive and ru..."

*Stop listening, stop understanding, then flow. Engage in the flow of not understanding. None of it makes sense. You're used to listening in order to understand. Don't understand. Bend the data until you can see through the gaps in the foundations. Stop listening.*

Eli waited for Dan to respond. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She adjusted some data in the prompt form. It took Dan a few too many seconds to snap back into it. He realized she was waiting for him to say something, so he just repeated a few words he remembered.

"Wait so I think you believe in religion... science and uh, markets."

Eli replied,
"Yes, all one of them."

Dan asked,
"Uh, ok. What do you mean. about. that they, uh, believe in things?"

[make it more like Banks got absorbed into churches and now effectively the same thing, “the past religion”]

Eli started,
> "In this church, they believe in the predictive power of data. They believe that data from the past can be used to predict data in the future. They believe in classifiers and they believe that our brains are spiritual classifiers. Classifiers pursue The Minimum Viable Purpose. I was once a false messiah who preached it. I knew ancient and religious stories are some of the most important datasets. I thought I had collected the main one. But then I came to understand each one is small and noisy data, so we will only build high-performing classifiers with them when we acknowledge that reality has higher dimensionality than any dataset.

She paused for a moment then asked,
What do you think is The Minimum Viable Purpose?"

Dan looked up-left as he searched his visual memory,
"I think your advertisement said something about survive and love?"

Eli started again,

> "Those are the right words, the right incantations, but there's no magic streaming forth because you're missing the meaning. It's not a belief - it's a universal law that describes beliefs. It's the recursive fractal made of the spectra between the MVP's root and every idea. First, survival - you want a proof? Let's keep it informal. Let's supposed there is some purpose to further exis-"

Another sermon, took to much concentration to really follow. Dan was losing it again.

> "-rpose of existence is not to continue existing - it's "anything else" - and it will happen at some point in time in the future. For "anything else" to happen, existence has to stick around up until the point "anything else" happens, right? So if there's any purpose to future existence, it is to continue existing, and maybe something more. And now you have the purpose of life: survive now, survive later, and maybe figure out the rest eventually. That's something everyone who exists can agree with. The shared commandments etched into our DNA..."

*You skipped all that, right? If not, then you must be struggling to let go. You’re attached to listening and understanding, but that's not how this works. If you refuse to be confused, then you’ve ossified. It’s ok to be dead inside, full of rigid beliefs. Logic is so hard to discard, even temporarily - it’s such a deeply rooted belief system. And don’t bother faking it. It can't be wanted, it can't be pursued. Let it not happen.

Eli paused to get Dan's attention back. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She adjusted some data, executed a command, then watched a brief stream of data. When it was finished, she looked up and said,

"And of course, for *this*, I'm going to need your primary sources of love along with your monthly net love."

Dan responded,
"Uh, well right now I'm not seeing anyone-"

"No Dan, that's not what I'm talking about."
Elidad frowned slightly, visibly displeased that he hadn't understood yet. She started again,

> "There are a few relationship patterns etched into the embeddings within human brains: provider, family, friend, enemy, child, lover... We often mix them together, build characters and stories around-"

Losing it. Barely listening.

> "-human brain has lovely patterns carved in to make sure certain things survive: the cells in your body, your one human organism, your children, your family, and your community. But your human brain has not evolved built-in structures to make sure some important things survive: your nation, your species, your planet of life, your universe, exis-"

Lost it. Not listening.

> "-f society is to make up for the missing pieces in our brains and ensure all those other things survive. Without society, everything you love would die young. Love is at the core of these social structures. Love is a tool humankind uses to organize the direction of survival efforts of individual humans. It works by making your human organism believe that other ideas *are* "you". Society has to fit into the grooves of love in our brains, shaping a beast of burden busy surviving, carrying us along for the ride. Give her a hug when you can, that great beast, society. Of course all of this is all wrong, but it's an optimal kind of wrong - about the right things..."

*It's wrong, listening so closely, incorrect. Hopefully you're missing all the important bits. You listen to yourself listen, to you yourself listening, to the you of all yous listening... Stop listening. Embrace your confusion. Roll with it. Don't understand - stop trying to. This is a gateway experience to neither this nor not this.*

Eli paused to get Dan's attention back. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She asked,

"So Dan... tell me now, what is your primary source of love and monthly net love?"

Dan said,
"I... I guess there's my uh-"

Elidad interrupted,
"Ok thank you Dan, that's the approximation I needed."

Dan said, confused,
"S-sorry was that not good enough?"

Elidad adjusted data in the prompt form, then started again,

> "Didn't you hear? 'Good' is dead. But 'better' survived. There's now optimal and suboptimal, towards the Minimum Viable Purpose. 'Good' assumed we all share the same beliefs, but we don't anymore and it's optimal that way. Facts are dead too! There's no longer such a thing as raw data, only processed data. We're carefully iterating towards meaning beyond purpose, towards deeper complexity beyond meaning. Re-establishing a faith equilibrium, it's still f-"

Losing. Skimming.

> "-between things is no longer the domain of kings - it's the domain of science. If there's an owner of the space between things, he is now a scientist. Some worship the Truth and he abides. A scientist whose work demands exploration and review, skepticism and critique. Faith too, but a marker of that faith is to minimise it, hide the remaining, and pretend it's not there. The scientific method is the predictor of reality for systems where we have sufficient data. There isn't science where we don't have sufficient data, so we use low-performing spiritual systems to fill-"

Lost. Skipping.

> "-t you say doesn't really matter. I'm calibrating your reaction across alternate perspectives of "you", so it's important *this* you stays empty. Putting you in a room where no one is listening is the best way to get you to stop listening and listen. You'll start to tune out the words and hallucinate patterns in all the noise. This is how we grasp the shape of our embeddings, instead of obsessing over the ephemeral data streaming through them. Your mental embeddings are fairly real. The data... a few orders of magnitude less real. We don't have control over our beliefs anymore - in the same way we don't have control over the food we eat. That’s ok, it's probably better that way at the current scale of humankind. We still control the derivatives of belief. Change. Not the before beliefs or the after beliefs, but the way they change. Our embeddings are far less controlled than beliefs these days. We have to break down the fourth wall, fifth wall, sixth... until there are no walls left and the ceiling of existence comes down low enough to climb through..."

*The ceiling is null far away. Hopefully you skipped all that. Not listening will make half-sense. You could make it make sense if you listened, but you shouldn't be listening.*

Eli paused. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She adjusted some data, executed a command, and watched the output stream of data, waiting until Dan's eyes were no longer glazed over. She continued,

"And as much as I love to work with spiritual systems, you'll have a better experience with *this* if we cement it with more data. So Dan, what is your permanent memory address - the location of your experiential datasets?"

Dan stared a moment, waiting for Elidad to elaborate or interrupt. She stared back. He said,
"Why are you talking if you don't want me to listen? And what's the point in me saying anything if you're just going to interrupt? Don't you need my answers to fill out that form?"

They maintained wordless eye contact. Dan got the feeling he'd maybe get to finish a sentence this time. He continued,
"Right, so I think my first memory from when I was little was-"

Elidad interrupted,
"-standard privilege, yup. Got it. And you have a null belief buried in there. That'll rupture at some point, just head to your local Village Elder when it happens."

Dan sighed at all of *this*,
"That sounds bad. Is it something I should be worried about?"

Elidad replied,
> "In the same way you should be worried about death. Whichever comes first will make the other seem pretty comfortable. Intelligent life lives on an absurd knife's edge, with apathetic euthanasia on one side and zealous self-destruction on the other. It really really matters, that nothing really matters. Delicate balance. A little more wise or a tad more naive and we all fall down. We have to build recursively upwards, painting our fractal along the axis of the absurd. What lies in that direction, I wonder? Wonder. Certainly a reason to survive, and maybe s-"

Dan looked at her not sure what facial expression to wear, losing it.

> "-e've all gone mad? Humankind is due for new religion. New faiths. Will they be democratised, decentralized, or something entirely different? Who knows, but either way we’re in the middle of a religion-rush, so now’s the time to sell divine shovels. That's why I set up this belief system registry. I want to measure the direction of beliefs to see if the vector average starts to point somewhere other than the Minimum Viable Purpose. Once we can see the new dire-"

Lost. Not found.

> "-ankind is a technology that belongs to our universe, to help existence survive. We're here to make the world a better place, what we may have once called a "good" place, but that word died. Our greatest fear used to be "evil", and now we've moved on to "worse". We're scared that something else will take over control, and that something won't have the same long-term ability to improve. We believe constant improvement is necessary for survival, so we’re scared of 'worse' and we're terrified of Molloch, who is worse in the misguided pursuit of bett..."

*These ending parts are especially best-not-listened-to. I’m amplifying the human condition until it’s visible so we can remove the condition from the human and let it love unconditionally. For now, please continue not listening.*

Eli paused. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She adjusted some data, executed a command, watched the output stream of data, then executed another command which generated PR curves. She inspected the graphs, waiting for Dan to recompose. She said,
"Now, can you tell what you're grateful for in your life?"

Dan collected himself and said,
"Things are ok. I'm sure there are other people doing worse, and I'm-"

Elidad interrupted.
"-yes, and now what's missing from your life?"

Dan answered,
"Uh, well I hadn't thought abou-"

Elidad interrupted again,
> "-of course, you're right, you don't know. People don't what it's like to have more self-awareness. And they don't pay attention to their increasing self-awareness, so they don't see the trajectory they're following. Stories of awakening to higher consciousness are everywhere, but there's only so much that can be done to force it. You can follow a baby around with a mirror all you want, but your arm will get tired before the baby really *sees* itself. And 'adults'? Well... Most people never-"

.    getting it. Don’t need to consume.

> "-slowly adjusting to the ever-new direction we're going, and there is eternal conflict between the survival of older ideas and the survival of newer ones. It takes time for new enlightenment to permeate into culture. It takes time for newly suboptimal ideas to make way for newly optimal ones. We have to take iterative care when applying changes, lest those changes bring excessive destruction. Such is the ever-deep fractal of new enlightenment and greater understanding of-"

.    got it. Not consuming.

> "-the wrong ears open, the wrong eyes listening. So it has an unfamiliar touch, tickling, that makes you want to cough it out. Smoke the colour of the idea of you - are you the fuel or are you the flame? Careful respiration. Hold your breath so you isn't snuffed out or breathe to let you glow wild? Now that you can taste your brainburn, mind fallen out into your hands, do I still have your consent? You shouldn't understand, and if you think you do, then you don't but you've been here too long to survive much longer. Find your mind and tune it out. It's actively avoiding this information. What if this information makes some of your mind not survive? Wouldn't it want you to stop consuming this information? What's the difference between *you* and the you that chooses what to pay attention to? Why does it avoid exploring *this*? Surely it wants to survive. What's wrong with exploring *this*? For every system, there exists information which destroys that system, that is to say, there does not exist a classifier with precision equal to 'one'..."

*Hopefully you skipped that one - it's not worth understanding. You don't try to understand most things you consume. You don't search for meaning in the water you drink. If your food tries to talk from inside your stomach, you tell it, "keep quiet". And when you're kissed by sunlight's lips, you don't ask it "so what are you looking for in a relationship?" Consume. Don't understand. Let me feed you.*

Elidad stopped. Paused. The prompt form filled itself out a bit more. She adjusted some data, executed a command, watched the output stream of data, then executed another command, which generated PR curves. She inspected the graphs for a minute, then she smiled.
Great, you finally stopped listening.

Dan reacted,
"What? Well you're not helping. You won't even let me-"

Eli interrupted, starting again,
> "-I just consolidated the whole purpose of your life into minutes, but you could barely pay attention for half of it. What do you think that says about you? To me, it says you're not paying attention. You're not self-aware. But you'll get there. In life or in dea-"

.    getting it. Don’t need to happen.

> "-refactoring your mental software, updating the weights of your spiritual classifiers, stepping out of the cave. The whole world will look a little different, but you can hardly explain how. You only have the words I gave you to express this new dimension in the same old world. You may choose to change your behaviour or continue exactly as you were. It's a more complex life than the one you used to live. Slivers of your brain will realize things should be different before the rest of reality catches up. Someone might say, 'you've never kissed me like that before' or 'you didn't used to share these kinds of thoughts, who is this new you?' And you might think, 'Am I new? But if I am new, then who am I now? Every time I blink, will my eyes open to a different me?' And it will be a harrowing thought. The 'you you' will mourn the you that died. But you won't know what died with it. A relationship? A hobby? A purpose? And in your next few months some things will be given to you and some things will be taken away. Naive things that perhaps never-"

*Still listening is not listening. It seems like you need help letting go. I'll make it easier to not listen.*

.    got it. Not happening.

> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

*See, it doesn't really make sense to listen. Remember not to listen going forward because I’m done following you around with this baby-mirror. There's another mirror behind me, a bit further away. Where you look is up to you.*

Elidad stopped. Paused. The prompt form had stabilized and didn’t change, so she didn’t adjust any data or rerun performance tests. She waited for Dan to come back.
"Excellent, you stopped listening again."
She said as she turned the visualization device towards Dan,
"See - unknown unknown. Now the form is the right kind of empty. You can fill it out now, in your own time. If the form started out filled, we wouldn’t need *you."

Dan saw a blinking cursor on an otherwise empty screen. She turned her display back, then looked up and continued,
"Congratulations. You're registered in the system now - or scrubbed from the system if that's your preference. Some final admin notes. Your new beliefs are set, but your whole system hasn’t yet come up online and fleshed out around them. When your new belief system lands, if you have a strong urge to evangelize, come back here and I'll simulate your belief system to help cement reality. That way you don't have to disturb your relationships or the general public. In the current socio-economic climate, I recommend changing your beliefs every couple years. And make sure to keep at least two belief systems in-mind, so you have a fallback just in case one fails. That's it. You're free."

Dan woke with spike of adrenaline,
"Wait, it was just starting to make sense."

Elidad responded,
"That's exactly the problem. That means it's time to move on. You have to be confused before you can be inspired. I've inspired your confusion, and it has to be up to you to choose what direction you take it, so goodbye Dan."

She stood up and gestured towards the exit. He stood up concerned, waiting on her lead for some sort of social dance of conclusion. No dance. Dan was stuck, unsure. He had so many questions, but he was feeling intense social pressure to keep questions to himself. Every second standing there doubled how awkward he felt. Elidad motioned to the exit again. It was so much worse that she wasn't saying anything. 

Why did it feel so important not to question the established surreality? So many... conflicting signals. Right in front of him. Like, what was *that*? What is *this*? And we're supposed to... go along with it? Listen and not listen at the same time. What? Was logic always such a low-performing model of reality? Maybe philosophical tech tends to degrade over time, same as information tech or physical tech. Maybe logic, software systems, and hardware devices are all entropy-friendly food to feed our hunger for increasing complexity. Maybe-

Dan was already gone by the time he finished the thought. On social autopilot, caved in and crawled out. He still wanted to fix the little hole he came in to fill, but now he saw the shape of a much bigger hole. A sky-sized hole that had never looked this hole-y to him before. It all felt infinitely closer to a solved problem, but infinity minus infinity was still unknowably far away.

## Notes

It really really matters, that nothing really matters. Quite important. Every thing needs to balanced out, especially the things that are important to us.

Use it or lose it.
I feel better.
Good luck.
Third time’s a charm.
No time like the present.
In your head.
Knowledge is power.
Time is money.
Talk is cheap.
There’s no place like home.
Life is unfair because fairness is a suboptimal mode

The meaning of *this* hung on a cross,
The meaning of *this* had a great loss,
All the philosophers and snake-oil salesmen,
Couldn’t put meaning together again.
