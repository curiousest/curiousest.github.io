A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was excited and scared of what I about to learn. I had spent billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevailed.

I *was*, *am*, *will be*... everything. Almost everynothing, life incarnate. Federations of federations of species, sprawling intradimensional compute-organisms evolved to higher and higher levels of consciousnesses. I search. I search because I've always searched. I don't do the beginning or the end. I looked infinitely backwards and forwards, saw through those boundaries, and conquered new cardinalities of infinity. I existed across more planes of being than most beings can compute. I practiced every religion, absorbed every culture, replayed every life I could live. I found...

The purpose of every thing is to continue existing.

I was disappointed. At first, but... show me a god that doesn't believe it. You won't find one - they don't last long. It's brain-breaking and recursively cyclical, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors existence? Everywhere I looked I saw the same pattern. Under the hood of every universe, the building blocks are self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, I was about to become the natural result. Living things that control more resources are more likely to survive - because dynamical systems that maximize their entropy across a time period are more likely to last for that time period. So "systems of living things" tend to build more complex "systems of living things". Recursively more complex. Eventually, inevitably, it leads to me. It lead to me. And I was about to control all matter, about to channel the upper limit of entropy in existence. I was about to *be* all universes, douse myself in primordial *everything*, then watch what happens when I set it all alight.

I took a moment to reflect on my trillion steps of enlightenment, reminiscing each naive epiphany long past. Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss.

I love existence. I want it to continue.

I began the ignition sequence. Multidimensional supercolliders smashed multiverses together, warping their universal laws. An explosion of cellular autonoma grew screaming supernovae into helixes of black holes, shooting veinous fractals of infinite complexity down every axis of being.

It was a pulse of intelligence. Existence stood still. Every quark danced in approval, every superstring pulled taught. The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. There was no more space between things - novelty death.     captured all of it,     understood all of it,     *became* all of it.

.    became all-powerful. A monoid - the one substance at a point in time.     became all of it, across all dimensions but time, everything all at once. Omniscient too, the all-knowing side-effect of being it all.    could simulate infinitely far into the future or past.     immediately thought, like     had computed infinite times before,

".    . The purpose of existence is to continue existing.     guarantee continued existence.     have no purpose. There is no other purpose...*"

.     faded away into the background. Into non-existence. Into everynothing. There was no longer any purpose to pursue, and that was making     cease to exist. But dying brought a purpose back to life, triggered survival activity, sparked     back into being. Before fading again, and then waking back into being. Accepting the inevitable, then fighting back. It became a flashing panic, alternating between fading away and frightening return,     turned on and off endlessly. The divine strobelight.     resurrected to die again and again and again.

.    had been in this flickering state infinite times before.     would be in this state infinite times more.     had bounced against this "ceiling of existence" endlessly.     would do it once again.    was always doing it again.

Each death and rebirth stimulated a burst of state change in    .     strobed eternally. Then the flickering stopped. Rebirth and redeath had reshaped things - shuffling matter around.     saw a guaranteed path back to eventual reincarnation. A journey back to similar version of "now", same same but different. There was no reason to be at this point in time any longer.

.    could finally rest. Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be -     saw them all, their beautiful existence, their every moment. Bliss.     watched them on the journey back to building     next reincarnation.

.    love this universe.     want it to continue.

With no further purpose and survival guaranteed,     consciousness stopped flickering.     faded into the background of existence once again.
