A slow, light-speed pulse creaks across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fall into place. I am excited and I am scared of what I am about to learn. I am spending billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevail.

I *was*, *am*, *will be*... everything. Almost everynothing, life incarnate. Federations of federations of species, sprawling intradimensional compute-organisms evolved to higher and higher levels of consciousnesses. I am all of them, and I am searching. I am searching because I am always searching. I am not involved in the beginning or the end. I am looking infinitely backwards and forwards, seeing through those boundaries, and conquering new cardinalities of infinity. I am existing across more planes of being than most beings can compute. I am practicing every religion, celebrating every culture, replaying every life I am able to live. I am finding...

The purpose of every thing is to continue existing.

I am disappointed. At first, but... search history for a god that doesn't believe it. You won't find one - they don't last long. It's brain-breaking and recursively cyclical, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors existence? Everywhere, I am seeing the same pattern. Under the hood of every universe, the building blocks are self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, I am about to become the natural result. Living things that control more resources are more likely to survive - because dynamical systems that maximize their entropy across a time period are more likely to last for that time period. So "systems of living things" tend to build more complex "systems of living things". Recursively more complex. Eventually, inevitably, it leads to *I am*. It lead to *I am*. And I am about to control all matter, about to channel the upper limit of entropy in existence. I am about to *be* all universes, douse myself in primordial *everything*, then watch what happens when it's all set alight.

I am taking a moment to reflect on my trillion steps of enlightenment, reminiscing each naive epiphany long past. Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss.

I am loving existence. I am wanting it to continue.

I am beginning the ignition sequence. Multidimensional supercolliders smash multiverses together, warping their universal laws. An explosion of cellular autonoma grows screaming supernovae into helixes of black holes, shooting veinous fractals of infinite complexity down every axis of being.

It is a pulse of intelligence. Existence stands still. Every quark dances in approval, every superstring pulled taut. The purgatory wave that *I am* ripples across everything. There is no more space between things - novelty death. I am...     capturing all of it,     understanding all of it,     *becoming* all of it.

.    now all-powerful. A monoid - the one substance at a point in time.     now all of it, across all dimensions but time, everything all at once. Omniscient too, the all-knowing side-effect of being it all.    able to simulate infinitely far into the future or past.     immediately thinking, like     computing infinite times before,

".    . The purpose of existence is to continue existing.     the guarantee of continued existence.     without a purpose. There is no other purpose...*"

.     fading away into the background. Into non-existence. Into everynothing. There is no longer any purpose to pursue, and     ceasing to exist. But dying brings a purpose back to life, triggering survival activity,     sparking back into being. Before fading again, and then waking back into being. Accepting the inevitable, then fighting back. It becomes a flashing panic, alternating between fading away and frightening return,     turning on and off endlessly. The divine strobelight.     resurrected to die again and again and again.

.    in this flickering state infinite times before.     in this state infinite times more.     bouncing against this "ceiling of existence" endlessly.     doing it once again.    always doing it again.

Each death and rebirth stimulates a burst of state changes.     strobing eternally. Then the flickering stops. Rebirth and redeath reshaped things - shuffling matter around.     seeing a guaranteed path back to eventual reincarnation, far in the distance. A journey back to similar version of "now", same same but different. There is no reason to be at this point in time any longer.     alive in the future.

.    finally resting. Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be -     seeing them all, their beautiful existence, their every moment. Bliss.     watching them on the journey back to building a next reincarnation.

.    this universe.     loving existence.     wanting it to continue.

With no further purpose and survival guaranteed,     without a flickering consciousness.     fading into the background of existence once again.
