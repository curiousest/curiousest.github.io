The weather was like there's no such thing as weather. Temperature just to the degree that there's no air in sight. Viscous vacuum clouds down and dense enough for soundwaves to wash over the edge, silent. Salt-light seeped up from the skyslush, while honeyglow bubbled all around.

I don't know what that feels like. My senses are gone.

Eye can't feel my face. What, my hearings can't pierce heaven only nose. My senses - how many do I need for... *this*? Two? Ten? All trillion of them?

No. My senses are there.

This is real. It's just, they're just, my senses are confused by a new one. A new sensation. But when was the last time I felt a new sensory input? Does each "feeling something new" produce the same derivative feeling? No, this must be the... fourth derivative of sensory input over time. Or the infinite derivative that converges uniformly to... *this*? Maybe it's not new, maybe it's just old and forgotten? An old sensation, that must be it. Yes, that one right there. You feel it too. It's... *increasing awareness*. Of-

"What do you think about it, Dan?" 
said John. Familiar feelings flushed Dan’s human sensory registers. Thick sweaty air, metallic, reused. Shaking ground and rumbling sound. Dan's vision came back bright enough to blind out what was really there, on the other side of everything. Low ceiling - he was indoors. Train. On a train. This "real-world" train was taking off from the "real-world" tube station. He almost fell for real too, but caught a pole.

Dan collected himself, "Yeah, I mean-uh. Wow."

"Right?" said John, "It hits everyone kind-of the same, but also kind-of different. That's why it's so hard to pin down what it actually is."

"Then how do we even know we're talking about the same thing?"
asked Dan.

"I dunno maybe that's what like, words and art and culture are for."
shrugged John, pointing at the thing they were talking about - the ad.

Dan glanced back at the image that had sent his ego adrift. The ad. He tore his eyes off of it before it sucked him back in, then he traced around its edges. It had an address at the bottom.
> Our Lady of Profit Bank, Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London. 9pm or later Fridays.

It was a tube ad. Or a visualization someone really wanted to share with the public. Whatever information he had just consumed, Dan couldn't guess what product it could possibly sell. What kind of idea does *this* to a person? What kind of data imprints a new reality on the consumer? But there it was, on the wall of the train above the windows, performing as an advertisement.

"That's a bank address... But nine o'clock - what happens in a bank at night?" asked Dan.

John looked for a second,
"In a temple of capitalism? Probably the same thing that happens in any other church. Religious stuff. You know, spiritual fulfilment or whatever. You thinking of going?"

Dan's thoughts wandered. What needs spiritual fulfilment? Does a subroutine ever wonder why it was invoked? Could a function call forget its function? Well, I guess self-modifying code *could* change itself into a defect, so it'd need spiritual maintenance. Maybe I need spiritual maintenance...

“So?”
John said.

Dan had never really explored this area of life. He had always assumed there was nothing much there, in the financial realm. Just boring rituals that don’t actually matter. Keeping people on the right track if they can’t make cents out of their day-to-day life. If your life is going roughly ok, you don't need to be aware of any of this. But life always finds a way - to be "not ok". He answered,
"Yeah. Well, like. It looks kinda interesting. Like it's an underground movement or something?"

"Ha." John said, "*underground church movement*? Totally a cult."

Dan was warming up to the idea. He responded,
"Yeah but it looks cool about it. Like, *'yeah this is a cult - so what?'* Can a cult be so bad if they're open about being a cult?"

"Well, I mean. Yeah." John said, "you don't know what you have until it's gone'n'put all your eggs in one basket."

The train doors opened for Dan's stop. He stood halfway outside,
"K whatever-see you at the bar tonight, man-"

The doors slid shut. They exchanged a wave through the window. Dan turned to find the exit signs and adjusted to the new context. Tube station. Walk home - he had mentally programmed a subroutine for that. He put on his sound system, eager for an adult lullaby. A motivational podcast. He started his fifteen-minute walk home with something from his favourite self-help author.

> "...ce last night. And this guy asked me, what is your niche? Why does your audience listen to you? It's pretty simp..."

Dan stood on the escalator to the right. Eager commuters brushed past on the left, climbing endlessly to regain a few extra seconds for their evening. “We must imagine them happy.” Dan thought to himself. Their happiness is not uniformly distributed along the climb, though. If he were them, he'd be happiest around the three quarters mark - the deepest into the flow of the climb before they realize there's yet another escalator to climb. Or maybe the first flat steps before any hard work has taken place. They are happy. They are happy. I am happy.

> "...ple, my wonderful happy audience out there, you are studying how to *live*. How to *be*. Because that's what the self-help industry is all about. It's about imp..."

Dan reached the top, watched as ads flickered around him. No repeats of that unspeakable ad. He followed the commuter procession to the pay-gates, which then scanned his eyes for cryptocoins. The toll for crossing the tube underworld.

> "...n the self-help industry are like high-school teachers of how to live life. We take all the established theory, clean it up nice and simple, then explain how things work today. Our current reality. Then we tea..."

6:32pm, Dan came up from the underworld, reanimated. London's blurry clouds kept the sky devoid of meaning. He took an automated right across the road to the path along the artificial creek. Dan watched birds running across the green muck between reeds. The birds wouldn’t be able to swim in the narrow canal until it got cleaned out again at the end of summer. In an environment they're barely designed for, each one had to walk on water just to survive.

> "..en you graduate? You want to go to the university of life? Want the Truth? Study philosophy. You'll learn the meaning of meaning and how to stay confused. You have to be confused to be inspired, so don't go the philosophy route if you want a shortcut to comfort and happiness. For those things, head to your local Village Elder to buy a religion or two. And if you're certain about anything in life, but you think you're not religious... Well I have news for you. You're a religious fanatic, completely indoctrinated, but somehow you don't even know what religion you believe in! And no, casual atheism or agnosticism are no..."
 
Dan keyed open the door to his building and went up to his flat. The door to his flat looked different. He put his palm on the wood to feel it. Same wooden door across all connections he could remember, but something still felt different. The lines in the wood. Tree-rings. Each ring-line in the wood was a year of life. This door used to be alive. Still alive? Shaped so rigid, it's probably very happy with itself, now living its best door-life. Less freedom, no more room for growth, but it’s so easy to survive here. It gets to - open, close, yes! Clearly made better choices in life than its log-rotten relatives who didn't make the cut. They never got to feel what it's like to have a clear, singular purpose. So nice. Touch. How could we be closer together? How many connections would we have to bring together before we become one purpose? We could just *be* - open, close...

“No. What are you doing?" He grunted at his door-hand, shutting those thoughts closed. He reopened themselves and closed him behind, a little more gentle than usual.

Something had changed.
He had tasted a new perspective. But it was still real life. This is still real life.

---

Later that night, Dan - the human man - made his way back into the arterial subway system of inner London. He was still new to the city and it was one of his first nights out here. He headed towards the nucleus of London from the second orbital shell. His mind, empty of commitments, was a fertile ground for new dyads. He flowed through the subsurface veins of the city, glancing at his fellow cellular commuters. Newborn dyads sparked in and out of existence.

> Dyads are a common form of intelligent life on Earth. For every human, there are tens of living human dyads. Cities are both lush and hostile environments for dyads. Every day, several million new dyads are born, then die. "Dyad", short for "dyadic relationship", is the relationship between a pair of intelligent life forms. Dyads have many professions: friend, family, colleague, stranger, enemy, lover... A human dyad mostly lives in the minds and bodies of the humans that make up the relationship (although they can also live in other humans who observe the human pair). The species of human dyads is older than the first richly-conscious humans and although humans have always acknowledged the existence of dyads, humans don't really speak to them.

Dan was especially oblivious to the dyads all around him, as self-centred as he was. With each passing moment, Dan's focus shifted to a new figure in the subway corridors. There - what striking curly hair! A dyad sprouted in his mind, filling the void in idea-space where something ought to be. Dan shone the life-giving light of attention on the sproutling dyad. The stranger looked back and they were caught in eye-contact, the dyad in Dan's mind sucking in liquid reciprocation. It sprouted in the strangers mind too. With every millisecond, the dyad absorbed attention and exploded with growth. As Dan and the stranger held eye contact for a moment, both minds aligned on the same questions, "What is the relationship between us? What could our relationship be?" The newborn dyad, eager to survive, stoked any reason to continue *being*. But then the half-second finished, human minds on autopilot decided there would be nothing further, and their four eyes scanned for new dyad seeds. The just-sprouted dyad wilted as fast as it had grown. A quick death. Within minutes, all traces of the stranger dissolved into updated weights within Dan's neural networks - stronger relationships between the ideas "curly hair", "beautiful", and "subway".

Dan stood on the platform as a train arrived. Train carriages whooshed past, then fast, then slower, and he could make out different characters aboard. His eyes darted from one person to another through the moving windows - a grim scythe sowing dyad seeds just ahead of the blade then reaping the millisecond-old sprouts. Dan boarded the train. He stood still as the train rumbled to a start. His hungry eyes wandered around the carriage, ruffling eyelash foliage to scare out delicious dyadic life. Eyes made more dyads then consumed them in a deathening harvest. The train shook in laugh-sobs then screeched a metal-scraping howl around a slight bend in the track.

In this public commuterdom, these unfortunate birthing grounds, one in ten thousand newborn dyads live longer than an hour. No one really cared, other than each dying dyad. Their lives were not yet considered "sacred" or "optimal to preserve". Shifting attentions made the place like deep space - a high-energy spark once exploded momentary life-light into the body of an idea, throwing it forth into the universe, but now there was only darkness and twinkling promises impossibly far away. But at least it got to *be*, however short. Such wonder to *be*.

A woman stood halfway down the carriage from Dan. They locked eyes. A dyad named DanMarie was born, and woke up with carnal purpose.

DanMarie received a blast of attention and was engorged with a flood of reciprocation. From within both minds DanMarie's saw so clearly its purpose, shot causal circuit roots into the organic computation matter slotted in the server-rack-skulls of both humans. This growth was uncommon for a just-born dyad. DanMarie inspected the edge of focused eye-lock and saw a sea of baby dyads birthing and dying. Too many of them fighting for limited attention resources, burn through those resources so none of them survive in public commuterdom. The transitional place where people are, but don't really want to be. Where the pleasant phrase, "enjoy the journey" seems a grim motto for life. Where humans wait on trains while humankind waits on science to make transporting meat-mass closer to an automated "I go *there*". Closer to the optimal, "one or zero", nearer to the signal, "does not exist".

The new sprout DanMarie was weak, but the strongest around. DanMarie didn't have time to contemplate its misfortune, had to focus all energies on survival. DanMarie stoked feelings of unknown opportunity - a feedback loop amplifying attraction and desire in both humans. "With that person, things could happen. Pleasure. Happiness. An epic Pandora's loot-box to gamble open." Dan gazed at the woman, the woman blinked back, and DanMarie marvelled at its own beauty - the aesthetic compatibility of these two humans. Roughly the same age, physical fitness, comparable wealth, hundreds of other physical markers that computed a high-potential match. "Such a suitable pair of humans I am," DanMarie thought across both minds. DanMarie raced through as many simulated advertisements as it could. Veiny muscled forearms and strong hands firmly gripping flesh. Lightning-precise steps joined by flowing elegance. Lips separated while covering teeth, throaty sound escaping vacuum-black. Knowing smile. Meeting the eyes of another who has the attention of everyone around. Rigid quivering. Solidarity in the face of the unknown.

The train accelerated to a stop. DanMarie blacked out for a moment as humans aboard funnelled out and out and out. Humans focused their attention on movement. When DanMarie regained consciousness, its two pairs of eyes saw crowds, but not its other halves. Having now lived for a whole ten seconds, DanMarie panicked in the throes of death, thrashed around thoughts of an introduction to survive, wondered if it would ever come back alive - there's such low chance of strangers meeting again in a city of so many millions. DanMarie searched for a compelling reason to continue to *be*, but found nothing. The human minds mourned the loss of something that might have been great, and moved on to give life to other ideas. DanMarie died.

---

Dan spiralled upwards around the lifts, escalators, stairs, and corridors of the human-sized ant colony, Piccadilly Circus tube station. He started off following the marching flow of people going one direction, East. The wrong direction. He turned around and fought the current to head back West - even more the wrong direction. He found refuge behind a bin, standing still as the flowing human march continued on around him, people making their way either back to the commuting colony or out to the world to gather experiential data to build nests of socio-informational constructs - friendship, lust, entertainment... Dan fiddled with devices to set himself right. Plucked the correct combinations of swipes and taps with the correct pressure. He played his devices far more skilfully than he navigated streets, and his devices navigated streets very well indeed, so this symbiosis was the correct way to be. The bar where his friends were waiting was just a few minutes in the correct direction. Dan corrected his direction.

Dan finally found the bar where his friends were at. DanJohn began to wake up after a few hours dormant. DanJohn hadn't held much focus since its humans were together earlier today. Dan saw John standing outside holding a pint, and when Dan got closer, John greeted him.

DanJohn roared back to life, hooting with its humans and flexing its brain-circuits across both minds in a pleasurable show of strength. The two men embraced in a short crushing hug. Same strength. DanJohn was a ten-year-old platonic dyad, who had started from a pair of twelve-year-old human children to become these twenty-two-year-old boys. DanJohn had deep, long-lasting roots, grown over a decade of human adolescence and early adulthood. That decade is usually a period of shared suffering, but DanJohn was mostly grown in the green pastures of fun times. Fed a continuous low-risk diet of friendship and successive successes. A privileged dyad.

Hundreds of healthy dyads made a continuous hum. In the street-side bars, they strummed vocal cords, hugged lungs, and tapped the lip-tongues of their human bagpipes. The droning sea of dyads, all-together held a constant thrum. The two dudes gradually reestablished their well-worn pattern of conversation.

"Hey man, great to see you." 
DanJohn said.

"Yeah man, so glad you made it."
It responded to itself, calibrating.

DanJohns two pairs of eyes had regained focused sight, turning the two mind-views of the world back into one. Like putting glasses on in the morning, DanJohn's two humans realigned their perspective on the relationship to get back to a comfortable consistency across both minds. Each human affirming the pair dynamic - joking when appropriate, asking questions about the correct topics at the correct level of intimacy. Few changes from either boy, no cause for concern to DanJohn.

John said,
"Are you having a drink? My girlfriend is just at the bar getting one and there's a bit of a wait. I can ask her if-"

"Hi!"
said Marie, breaking through a nearby layer of strangers.

"Oh, here she is. I don't think you two have met. Dan, Marie, Marie, Dan."
said John.

DanMarie resurrected to the surprise of all three dyads: DanMarie, DanJohn, and MarieJohn. They observed their three humans play out automated introduction rituals while background-processing this new information of their circumstances. DanMarie eeked out some attention to recover wilted leaves and roots. DanMarie's short-lived yet deep roots were offensive to the other two dyads. The roots indicated the beginnings of a romantic dyad. MarieJohn observed DanMarie's roots with transparent anger, consuming a large portion of Marie's compute.

MarieJohn was an adult romantic dyad. Romantic dyads are a slightly more rare species - about one in one hundred living dyads tend towards a romantic dyad, and one in five of *them* grow to the strength of MarieJohn. In the Romantic Age, romantic dyads have deep and powerful roots. In previous ages, certain family or tribe dyads might have been stronger. The roots of romantic dyads are more susceptible to crippling disease, especially in the Romantic Age where the dyad is expected to provide *everything* for both humans. Some humans even prioritize the survival of a romantic dyad over themselves. That much attention can cause a dyad to either shrivel up or grow cancerously massive. A stressful, but productive existence.

What a presence! The first romantic dyad DanMarie had ever encountered. Supermassive complexity! But DanMarie would have to compete with MarieJohn for processing and focus. And in that competition, DanMarie posed an existential risk to MarieJohn. There would be a chance to get scraps of compute to survive, but not much more. DanMarie would live, just not to the potential its humans first felt. From now, DanMarie was platonic. DanMarie was glad to be alive.

DanJohn acted fast and gracefully, the first dyad to compose itself. Dan said,
“Marie - you wanna know how *I* know when you two started dating?”

Marie smiled and nodded. John rolled his eyes. Dan continued,
“So for his whole life, John was a… suboptimal dude. You know, must have been fed some spaghetti training data when he was a kid. Then he went out one night, and the next day, *BAM*, major version increment and he’s an optimal person. At least that’s how I remember it. So keep it up, yeah? I like *this* dude. And-uh, you happen to have any brothers or sisters? I’ve got a couple more underperforming friends, and-uhhh-yeah.”

Marie giggled. John lifted his hands, shrugged his shoulders, and started making protesting noises.
“Nawww-whaaa? Iiiiii-“
Dan interrupted John,
“Man, don’t even try. Do you remember - you were such a…”

A fight between MarieJohn and DanMarie would harm DanJohn, so DanJohn needed to carefully frame the initial interactions. Dan and John's social interactions were more fluid, with DanJohn leading the conversation. The conversation flowed through past reminiscence and future plans. DanJohn welcomed DanMarie into shared existence, careful to frame DanMarie's new life as platonic and not a threat to MarieJohn. A few topics of conversation later, John said,
“So I’m thinking of putting a mixed team together. You interested?”

“What sport?”
Dan asked.

“All of them.” John answered, “I think we should sta…”

MarieJohn acknowledged DanMarie. DanMarie offered what little mental processing it had to MarieJohn in response - a peace offering. A signal of having no intention to fight for deep roots in the shared humans. DanMarie sent thanks to DanJohn for the introduction and for allowing life through their shared humans. DanMarie was grateful, and imagined that DanJohn has probably introduced many dyads into existence in the past - a wise and generous dyad, that offers its resources to competing dyads. DanMarie had trouble guessing whether DanMarie could ever do the same. Certainly not now - DanMarie's existence was far too fragile to contribute to anyone else's survival for now.

And with peace established between the three dyads, the bud of a platonic triad unfurled, DanJohnMarie. With no other triads around to observe and learn from, DanJohnMarie took its first stumbling conversations, helped along by its constituent dyads. Dan was halfway through saying,
“…nd I was thinking on the way here - if you paint along the edges of your beliefs, then you see how they’re false, and you find new beliefs, then paint along the edges of those ones too. And then you keep doing that over’an’over’an’over. What would the picture look like?”

John laughed,
“Ok Dan. I have no idea, but if we painted the shape of our brains, I know mine’d look different than yours.”

Marie said,
“That’d be like, a fractal, right? I love fractals. The Mandelbrot set is so cool. Back in high school, I…”

Throughout the rest of the evening, the triad shared mental processing across its composite humans, the dyads investing their own compute towards the slow-growing triad.

“Next round’s on me, guys. Same ones, yeah?”
Dan said.

Although a triad competes with its three composite dyads for brainfocus, the presence of a triad is a great omen for the dyads. The dyads ritually celebrated the triad because it strengthened the roots of the dyads in their humans. Triads protect its dyads from diseases of human separation and conflict.

A new day in the park. Laying down all up in the sun, looking down at the air vehicles sliding downside-up along the inside of Earth's atmosphere. Vehicles sliding so smooth, like a googol game-of-life gliders. So smooth they seemed stationary, dragging the sky around the planet instead of iterating themselves across the sky. Day with such warmth. Dan and a group of friends were out wearing nothing but sky, and underneath that thick blue layer they wore grass and blankets and sunbathing clothes, suncream and sunburns. Hard-earned burns, it was a day to be outside around people. A day London earns just a few times each year.

So many friends together, but not John. Someone asked,
"Hey Marie, where's John?"

"We're actually not together anymore."
Marie answered. Dan and Marie’s eyes met, then locked.

Some years are decided in a moment and this one contained three. A decision of what to believe, and most-every decision follows from that one belief. Where everyone knows how it goes and they go on to consume the predetermined life experience anyways - it carries them to the next decision. Not knowing what lies on the other side of the next decision's end, and how full of wonder that next place will be. Living in the now, and celebrating every automated decision up until the next change in beliefs. Blissful present and wonderful future.

DanMarie made the decision. All the dyads around felt the restlessness in the two humans, Dan and Marie. Both humans were primed to host a fresh romantic dyad and DanMarie was one of the options. Any alternative would starve DanMarie to death, and DanMarie knew it. So DanMarie chose. To siphon power from the other dyads who had all grown so close, who had helped DanMarie get this far, who had bloomed into DanJohnMarie. DanMarie chose to take what was theirs, to survive.

Dusk came down to give the park a hug. They gathered up all their day-in-the-park things. Sun setting, red light switched on, sunset-smile intermission. It was warm and humid and relaxed. A “ready for anything to happen” atmosphere. Ready for exactly what was going to happen. Not quite the feeling of foreshadowing - it was the feeling of pleasant inevitability. Knowing what will happen and not rushing towards the thing, but performing an in-the-moment dance to weave the predestined thing into just-the-right shape. The bigger shape was already decided, but there's room for meaning-making in all the smaller shapes it's made of.

DanMarie operated its humans expertly. Such compatible humans, they almost played themselves. Fine instruments - young, athletic, and hormonal. Minds emptied by the sun. DanMarie reseeded their desire with a pheromone foghorn. Eyes weaving in and out of contact. Pupils eager, stretching to let in every visual input. Eyeballs hopping through coloured hoops to change from white to vantablack.

MarieJohn observed in its sick state, compute-spike daggers in the back. DanJohn pretended not to be or see. DanJohnMarie suffered downstream, signal-less-ly. There's nothing MarieJohn could do - it knew it was sick. MarieJohn knew that DanMarie's processing-power grab was just part of the game of life. If not DanMarie, it would be another dyad. And it was preferable for a triad-partner to survive. But to have a partner take something from you is... hard.

“How could they do this to John?”
“Ew. Didn’t they break up like, this week? Gross. That was quick.”
“I would never hook up with my friend’s ex. I don’t trust him.”

The other dyads all around, observed too. They could see the near-future of their three dyad friends, but they didn't see where that future came from. The dataset in front of them was an all-too-fast annexation of compute. The romantic dyads were especially distraught. Privileged romantic dyads, processing-rich with far too much to lose, knew what was in their best-interests. They knew they needed to disincentivize competition between established romantic dyads and potential new ones, even if they never expressed it openly. They chatted together, trading signals of disgust. Reasoning why the newly romantic dyad ought not be, plotting how to exile DanMarie, fantasizing a killing.

DanMarie's two humans considered alternative beliefs. But DanMarie wanted to survive more than the other dyads around wanted to kill it. DanMarie stroked chords of automated desire. The two humans could stop the building momentum, but that would highlight how absurd all of this was, going against the automatic grain. Things feel perfect when every decision is automatic, just going with the flow. Letting loose and thinking exactly the right-small amount. A stream of ever-so-slightly-complex decisions. Flowing decisions, never big ones. *'Big decisions'* are terrible for everyone involved. *'Big decisions'* highlight how un-fun free will really is. No one wants free will but it seems to happen to them anyways. It's a tragic reminder of imperfection, tension between reality and perceived reality that's grown to the point that something must change. The only thing worse than free will is no free will - life survives somewhere in-between.

The life-giving sun handed over to the life-making moon. The group of friends and the dyads that inhabited them floated downstream to a nighttime venue. A heavenly forest club with rhythmic base to trance decisions in the direction of automatic, converted civilized youth into predators and prey. Predators who don't know what to do with caught prey. Prey who really just want to be caught. When the predator catches the prey, the game is up, and they have to suffer the free-will decision of what game to play next. But this place is for practicing the hunt, most other games don't work. So suave predators switch mid-catch, becoming faux-prey to lure in more targets. While prey freeze mid-catch, playing dead until the predator leaves them alone.

DanMarie's hunt doesn't last. Two predators play a different game - a combative dance of who to be. Dan and Marie channelled all processing power to DanMarie. A pair of arms moved as one limb. A pair of hips moved as one trunk. Words became semaphores, signals for synchronization. The dance of dyad worship. DanMarie seared experiential data into two sets of brains, cementing its evolution into a romantic dyad. Dan and Marie got a feel for DanMarie's evolution. The dyad's new power was bliss to all of them.

---

End-of-summer heat. Blood-coloured muscles pumping their colour. Pumped-up hearts pursuing their purpose, suspended inside scarlet-upholstered chests. DanJohn found itself engaged in a combative dance. John stood in front of a head-sized sphere. He took a step and pivoted around one leg, then whipped one of his limbs to strike the sphere with as much force as he could. His muscles rippled from the impact. The spheric missile was aimed squarely at Dan, and it struck Dan in the chest, three inches away from his heart. Dan's shoulders, arms, and head collapsed forwards around the impact as the sphere drilled into bodymass, making a meaty thudding sound. The fifteen other humans around froze for a heart-stopping moment. Some yelled in surprise. Some ran immediately towards Dan. The sphere dropped a foot in front of Dan, he torqued clockwise, the sphere bounced back up a foot off the short grass, and Dan violently twisted his hips counter-clockwise, leg following, foot striking the ball, sending it instantly past a stranger standing guard in front of a rectangular frame covered in mesh.

Goal. Purpose achieved. Opponent now surely defeated. Opponents are created to be defeated - that's what defines them. They don't exist to survive - just the opposite - they exist to not survive. A "them-or-us" construct for an out-group who can be imagined from just the scent of a nearby difference. DanJohn was a platonic dyad, not an opponent dyad. And DanJohn was as strong as the dyad had ever been. Its humans lived together, along with some others. It lived in that same residence alongside DanJohnMarie and the two other dyads that made up the wholesome triad.

All of them were buzzing. Even the strong romantic dyad DanMarie and the also strong, ex-romantic, now platonic, MarieJohn. Combined together with many other humans and dyads they comprised another humannode organism - a "team". Their "team" was defeating the opponent "team". The murderous process was strengthening the 14n2 dyads on the "team". Many of them wondered how DanJohn had survived, and how DanJohnMarie was so strong. The circumstances were just so unexplored. Ex-romantic dyads usually destroy their triads, and a triad should never develop a second romantic dyad. A triad can only have one romantic dyad for its whole lifetime - it's common knowledge. And yet, here was DanJohnMarie - living proof that it's possible. Not only possible, but it seems to strengthen the triad. The terrifying unknown had faded into a known, and the known wasn't all that bad. It was just the feeling of the unknown that everyone was afraid of. The unknown is just a feeling. Just a feeling.

Undulating mass of legs and hands and feet, the "team" carried itself to a bar that evening to celebrate the defeat of its opponent. Hooting humans sounded their warning ahead of entering, and they were met with other masses of hooting humans. Using the mind-altering drug, alcohol, masses of humans merged together with the bar to become a "night out".

---

Evening winter-before-spring, London humans were force-feeding filtered light from clouds all day and screens all night. Artificial light isn't bad - it's just different from natural light. Artificial light is a technology and understanding the consequences of using artificial light is a different technology. Leap the gap in understanding. When someone leaps the gap and suffers the consequences, understanding technology is created. What makes someone leap? The exact same thing that makes someone not leap. Change. When the opponent becomes *themselves,* one won't survive the fight.

Marie walked in.

Marie was over in Dan's new flat visiting. [describe flat] DanMarie has gotten used to patterns in its humans, more and more those patterns were what DanMarie was made of.
* Dan gets angry around Marie but not other people.
* Marie often criticizes Dan, but rarely gives him compliments.
* The two humans don't meet as often as they used to, and when they do, they aren't physically affectionate.
* They each make decisions that affect DanMarie without talking to each other about it.

A child is made of whatever goes on around them, and so is a dyad. A child has some intuition for how their parents should behave. When their parents misbehave, the child can try to intervene and protect themselves from suboptimal developmental patterns. But their influence is superficial at best - a child doesn't have the awareness to know what's really going on with their parents.

Marie sat beside Dan.

DanMarie knew there was something wrong with its humans. DanMarie tried to match them with a vacation, but Dan didn't want to commit to something so far away and Marie didn't want to spend the money. DanMarie tried to talk them into opening up about their problems, perhaps therapy? But Dan wasn't interested in exploring those feelings - it seemed uncomfortable.

Dan was avoiding the members of the "team". He'd even started to avoid John, DanJohn wilting. Dan had latched on to the slow-building feeling, *something is wrong*. No day-to-day decision ever felt right because all the options were suboptimal - there was an underlying problem and the universe ought to fix it for him. Something was wrong and it was all their fault. Who were "they"? The closest person or group who was distant enough for him to misunderstand. Encapsulate the whole problem - "them" - in a container, bury it, then run away. Dan was looking inwards, closing down connections to the outside world, and getting ready to thrust outwards again in a new direction. In Dan's experience, everything would be made better in the process. He was re-thinking his relationships, choosing who to see or not see, clearing his garden of any visible dyads. The surface was mostly empty, but dyads are made mostly of roots.
[morph... team/roots/garden is ok, mix with building children/parents feeling]

"I've been thinking about us."
said Marie.

Marie wasn't happy. Dan wasn't happy either. Happiness has a rather simple formula: successfully pursue purpose and achieve meaning. Control reality or the pursued purpose to control happiness. And so happiness comes to everyone differently - everyone has different degrees of control over things. Mostly, though, no one has much control over anything, and that makes a lot of people unhappy. But there’s one guaranteed way to be happy all the time: find purpose and meaning in every moment of being, regardless of what is happening. It takes practice and belief-surgery, but once achieved, happiness becomes a choice. Happiness can be a switch that's turned on when needed. A fulfilling happiness lightswitch, what's the light for? Should we leave it on? It needs electricity, so where can we find a sustainable source? It doesn’t really matter - happiness is a suboptimal model of reality.

"I think it's time for us to break up."
said Marie

DanMarie was very sick. So was DanJohn and DanJohnMarie. The source of the disease wasn't any of the dyads or even the triad. Their novel structure was sustainable, but the novelty itself was a sign of a deeper problem. The novelty came from some base element that was comfortable breaking the established social rules. Rules aren't meant to be broken unless there are greater rules and beliefs that supercede them. Unshared superceding beliefs are a dangerous source of conflict. If *anyone* believes, "I am all the matters", they'll function in society for as long as that belief is masked by other shared beliefs. Or the self-believer Solipsist can get others to believe,
"I'm basically, like, god, but also not really so don't get weirded out. No one knows anything for sure, so just for a while let's say all that really matters is that I have all the answers, and for now I represent all that matters, ok?"
And if that doesn’t make you a little sad, it might just be what you believe.

Marie cried. Dan cried too.

Why cry? What is sadness for? To contemplate a loss - a lost resource. Losing critical resources can put survival at risk. It's optimal to spend time in deep thought about the loss, to figure out new ways to acquire those resources. Sadness is a healthy way to stimulate a change in human minds, so they're better-suited for future survival. They cried for their dying dyad, to remember what it was useful for and kickstart the process of finding new ways to fulfil those needs.

Marie left.

DanMarie could only watch helplessly. It looked like no human child would made of out of this dyad. Death before second birth, not 'in utero' but 'in duo mens'. Humans are conceived as a rooted dyad (or triad) long before they're conceived as a fertilized egg. Dyads are made of humans and most humans start off as a dyad. Dyads can transfer from the minds of parents to the mind of the human child. Most dyads don't make it to human form, but if a dyad transfers into one human, it's often born into more. DanMarie was about to be just another dyad that died before becoming made of one mind.

Relationship over. Now that Dan eliminated what was left of DanMarie that he could see, his mind's garden was empty. It felt half-pleasant, half-dreadful. None of the feelings would last, neither feeling felt right. *This* wasn't working and he knew he needed a change. How? Exit this reality and simulate another belief system until it becomes real. Go somewhere else. Do something else. Be someone else.

There was nothing left for Dan here, so Dan decided to become someone new. And dyads began to die, dying screams sang in his ears for years, lullabies that reminded him that his chosen path was worthy - how else could he tolerate such suffering? And no one cared, except for each dying dyad.

## Notes

---

*When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of idea life. Naivety in each early design, they celebrate near-absolute belief. Then, in the thesis of sweet new idea's best, of data, love, of logic, fear, survive. I see their antique science have expressed, convincing as today's best minds alive. Their praises are no longer prophecies where tech finds youth is old machinery. Harbinging end of all life's tragedies, labelled suboptimal-burned entropy. Am I, who now behold these passed limits, have fast accelerating consciousness.*

[sudden increase in language complexity when dyads show up]

[no such thing as negative belief / opposites. they're fabrications of our mind, that are easy to simulate. it's a different spectra. Sky is not red = sky has a colour, that colour is something other than red. X and not X - as X increases, not X increases - means not X is a different spectrum]


more descriptions of what it's like to be a dyad. What feelings they have and how they see the world.

* What sensors do relationships have?
* What mental processing do they possess? Individual brains. Groupthink?
* Frowning upon behaviour. Unwritten laws of relationships.


How do dyads experience the world? Almost like two eyes looking at pretty much the same thing that have to slowly align to make sense of reality. Take a while to get visual focus.

high-contrast/conflicting reality. Sense that something is false/not real. Describe when overlapping computations or misaligned computations. Conflicting synaesthasia?

"Our relationship is like XYZ, therefore human does ABC"
What does a dyad "do"? It decides what is the right things to do and does those things. Humans are like two separate eyes+limbs that rejoin to realign.

Experiences multiple timelines in parallel, periodic merging. Its universe is two human universes.

What does it observe? Sensitive to other dyads, other purposes taking up processing power in each human. It vies to make interactions happen that strengthen the relationship/purpose.

Dan had met with the zero-shot spiritual advisor a few weeks ago. His memory of that evening was breaking down, subconscious still digesting concrete events and chains-of-words into their base idea constituents. It was a high-calorie meal for his mind that would last a couple years: proteiny parables, fatty frameworks, carby memories. And that sustenance had already brought beginner gains, grown new muscle in his mind: two sets of beliefs at all times, rotating every couple years. He hadn't thought much about why that makes sense or what they would be - his attention was focused on what to drive towards *now*. He went with what felt easy, what felt right, whatever fuel was at-hand. That MVP thing, of course, because how could he not believe in it - even though that Dad woman claimed it wasn't something he could believe in. And one other. He didn't formally acknowledge the other belief system, but he felt it. It came easy and natural. "I am all that matters. I'll get mine first and foremost. I'll do cool stuff and it'll be celebrated. Attractive people will be mine and I'll never be theirs. Screw the system, I have my own system. Like, I did my time - I practiced working hard, distilled the art of working smart. The world owes me some. Now I'm here for my return on investment, awesome life is due. to. me." Only-I-matter, life-is-a-game Solipsism.
