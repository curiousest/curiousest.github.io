*Every thing is conscious. You can simulate anything.*

Hey Dan, welcome to the Department of Life. Ugh, it's so great that you're here now, the team has been dying for you to join. They're out around, but we're all going to meet up for lunch. Alex from recruitment said you went on holiday to Dubai to check out the Department of Origins and the Department of Destinations. What did you get to see there?

Aw thanks, I'm so glad to be here. Yeah it was so interesting. My wife and I went to a lecture series, visited the museums, and we had a tour of the server farms and solar arrays. You know how they do it there, right? It's like a worldtree in a field of desert-grass. The solar arrays cover the whole desert, bending and twisting to face the sun. There's one huge building three kilometers high. The servers start from halfway to the top, so most people live in the bottom half of the building. Well, up to one mile, for religious purposes. After that it gets complicated, on the day of resurrection where the sun comes to within 1 mile of Earth, some don't want to touch Allah - the sun - and some do. Classic arbitrary division of beliefs. Anyways, at 2km altitude, the temperature is quite a lot colder and the air is still 80% as dense, so they use airflow lattices for cooling. With current tech, it's more energy efficient to have complex cooling sky-high in the middle of the desert than it is to move all the solar energy somewhere cooler.

Katie led Kal from the reception area to their office entrance [exposition]. Katie brushed past the obsidian obelisk that limited the door's range of movement, visually registering the alien form, but ignoring it.

Woooooow. No way! That's so cool. What were the lectures about?

Honestly, I didn't like it. It seems like they're still in the early stages, even though they're the oldest departments. I was a bit disappointed. All of the topics were really philisophical, like, "A New Catalyst for Cyclical Existence" and "Heat Death: Other Forms of Entropy". There wasn't much practical, "here's how to search that perspective space" kind-of lectures.

Yeah, simulating origin and destination haven't had any practical impact yet, so there's not much investment there. It's more physicists and philosophers working there right now. The more practical places are here at DoL, DLBM, and DPW. We call the other ones the "Dodos" D-o-O D-o-Ds get it?

What?

Oh sorry, acronyms, yeah. Dodos is about extinction - they're about the start and end of life and they're both going nowhere. DoO is Department of Origins, DoDs is Department of Destination. Then there's The Department of Life, The Department of Large Bodies of Matter, and The Department of Particles and Waveforms. I think our work at DoL is the most meaningful. They're simulating planets and molecules, superclusters and quarks. We're simulating *life*. We get to witness the birth and evolution of species from different universes. Like, holy shit, right?

That's... pretty cool yeah. I've been looking forward to working here.

Ok, well this is your desk here. Drop your stuff off and I'll bring you to the conference hall. You have a couple induction day presentations to go to now.

---

Dan sat in the conference hall with thirty-some others. He had flashbacks to his first lecture in university. A woman approached the podium.

Welcome new joiners! Everyone, I'm so glad you're all here. My name is Gladys, and I work on the people team here at DoL. You've all met your managers by now right? Yeah? Ok great. The agenda for the rest of the day is a couple presentations from different parts of the organization, then break for lunch before you meet back up with your team. Does that sound ok to everyone? Good.

I'm very pleased to introduce our first presenter, our Chief Science Officer talking about why we're all here. Of course by that I mean the purpose of the work here at DoL.

A bearded man with glasses approached the podium. He fidgeted with something behind a stand.

Hello fellow DoL-ites. Yes, I will be explaining what we do here. Let's start with a *story*. Has anyone heard the parable of the eukariotic cell? The first living thing on earth to experience 3D space?

Three of the thirty-some in the audience raised their hands. Dan had heard of it, but panicked about being singled out, so he kept still.

No? No problem - it's a pretty old story, but it's core to the mission of all the different simulation departments, including DoL.

### Parable of the new dimension

A microbe floated in a pool, absorbing the nutrients that collided with it. It used xyz as a sensor, and found that when some nutrients came from one side, more nutrients were likely to come from the same side. One day, it spontaneously expelled waste in the opposite direction from where the nutrients came in. That propelled itself into more nutrients and greater chances of survival. The descendents of that cell moved around more and more, learning to navigate 3D space. They were the first living things on Earth to discover, experience, and make use of 3d space.

https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xm726o/how_did_the_earliest_microbes_learn_to_move_in_3d/

That's the story. So the message hidden in there - it tells us how to explore new dimensions. Wow, so incredible right? Just think about that. The cell didn't know about 3D space, even though it was floating around and moving with the currents. Then somehow it moved accidentally, then somehow it learned to move intentionally. How could we use these lessons?

Well, this cell - in order to experience a new dimension (3D space) for the first time - it needed two things:
* An engine to "move" in 3D space. In this story it was expelling waste from one side of its membrane.
* A sensor to observe notable things in 3D space. In this story it was the presence or absence of nutrients.

There is a whole other space for us to explore - perspective space. What is perspective space? Across the planes of "perspective" are infinite ideas. For example, one plane could be all the kinds of cells that are possible. Another plane of ideas could be all the breaths I could ever take. Even more conceptual still is all the purposes of existence you could believe in. And ideas (like cells and breaths and purposes) have their own perspective on things. You can travel to that perspective by simulating what it's like to be that idea. I know that sounds crazy. Let me back it up.

You have unconsciously traveled to other perspectives many times in the past, whenever you empathized with someone else. Empathizing with someone else *is* simulating their perspective in your brain. Your brain is a space-time-travel device. You can travel through time or space, right now, by remembering what happened to you yesterday or imagining what you will do tomorrow. Your brain-simulations are pretty inaccurate and limited. You've always travelled through perspective space like a prehistoric caveman walking through the forest - barefoot and relying entirely on your body. But there are tools and technologies we can use to travel faster and more precisely, to reach clearer and more useful observations from another perspective. Maybe, like the cell, we'll find new and unexpected ways to survive better.

Now, what do we need to explore "perspective space" just like the eukariotic cell explored 3D space?

* An engine to "move" across perspective space. We need something to simulate the perspectives of those different ideas.
* A sensor to observe "notable things" while simulating perspectives. We need something to observe and analyze the simulations.

So with a simulator and someone watching the simulation, we can explore 3D space. Where should we go, then? Well with 3D space, it would be a big waste of energy to randomly explore. Imagine a cell trying to fly - we need a strategy to decide where to explore. So what in perspective space is worth exploring? Well we divided up perspective space into places that we think are cheap to travel to and might have some interesting results. In particular, there's a set of ideas that are inconsistent with the physical laws of our universe. These ideas belong to other universes. Why are those ideas important?

Imagine you are a blood cell and the universe is my human body. You move around in 3D space in my blood vessels - this is like taking the perspective of other ideas in our universe. What if you, the cell, moved to outside my human body? That would be like taking the perspective of ideas that belong to other universes. It would be a hostile environment, but an enlightening experience. You could learn about the complex powers at play that affect your host human body. Perhaps you could even find ways to influence those powers.

Simulation is a tool. We can use it to explore the dimensions of perspective and learn about the powers that affect our host universe. Here at DoL, we simulate and explore *life*.

Any questions?

A dude raised his hand.
"So those powers we're looking for. Is it almost like - if you wanted to take it to the extreme - like surviving in another body or universe gives you a certain immunity that you didn’t have before. Or like an idea of a transplant - when you take a set of cells from one body and move it to make another body to make it work better. So like, take a couple of people from one universe and send them into another universe to fix it."

"Well, yes. But there are even greater possibilities. For instance, what if you, the red blood cell, found out that my body was sick with sickle-cell anemia, then modified your fellow red blood cells to heal my body. Or what if the red blood cells found that my lack of money was the biggest threat to our shared existence, and began managing my investments for me? What if my red blood cells found technology to become even more capable than I am?"

Silence.

And about blood transfusions, which kinda means "people travelling to other universes". Random transmissions of blood happen - they're the primary vector of blood-borne diseases. Moving between universes might be achievable. It has probably even happened in the past. But even if that happens, to come back.... lightning must strike twice. We'll need to find the power of the gods to make that happen.

Another raises hand.

"Have we tried talking to our universe?"

Laughter.

Yes, a philisophical question. How do you know we're not in conversation with it right now? Maybe we're doing exactly what it needs us to do. Maybe it gently nudges us all the time. Maybe it's not conscious at all and never will be. Maybe it's just not conscious yet.

He paused for a moment for a breath.
What we know is that it exists and we exist in it. There are all great mysteries of our universe, the majestic beast we ride. All we can do is try to ensure our survival, and in that pursuit, we'll probably ensure its survival too.

Another raises their hand.

Why do we invest so much in exploring perspective space through simulations, but not... you know... space space? Out there. 3D space.

Great question. Economics! We are bound by the laws of capitalism. The expected return on exploring perspective space is greater than exploring "space space", as you call it. We're still exploring "space space", but just not to the same degree as perspective space. We have a great deal to learn in our universe, but we have a whole universe of universes to learn from in perspective space. We don't even need very good sensors or engines to learn quite a lot. Our fidelity of simulations is very low, and we still get results. Moving around in 3D space is very slow and very expensive. Our current investments in travelling 3D space are more for "reducing the risk of humanity becoming extinct", than they are for "discovering new technologies". Another way we explore 3D space in our universe is with light - light travels to us from all around, but it has many limitations. All the light is rather old, and we're getting mostly the same perspective all the time.

Think about it in a different way: moving around in 3D space is just another way of exploring perspective space. Our sensors we have when we explore 3D space are exceptionally powerful, but our engines are incredibly weak. With simulations, our sensors are not that great, but our engines are so fast - we can just zip around wherever we want. And like 3D space, we just kinda need to know roughly where to go. The different Departments are the different "areas" of perspective space that we believe are good places to explore in perspective space. The Department of Life explores simulating life forms in alternate universes. The other Departments simulate different promising things that happen in other universes.

Gladys interrupted,

And now we're at time for this talk. Thank you CSO, and also thanks you guys for such great questions. What a promising induction group, eh? We'll now take a five minute break before the next presentation.

Months came and went and Dan slowly got a handle on the DoL. Kat's team was working on life forms in universes with weak inter-universe interactions. Dan was working on the simplest kind of simulation: a strain of one-dimensional universes. In Dan's one-dimensional universes, there were near-infinite points along a line. Each point along the line had values 0 or 1. In extremely rare cases, the point could have the value 2. As time progressed, the points along the line would change in value over time according to some rules, like cellular autonoma. A common kind of rule, was "when two neighbouring points are 1 for a second, make the left one 0". With just a couple rules like that, complex life evolves quickly.

Dan was working on finding out how long it took for a 1D universe to produce complex life across a new dimension. He set up all the 1D universes alongside each other, like a lined piece of paper that could cover the whole length of Earth's equator. He made rules that set a point to the value 2 when the parallel 1D universes aligned in certain ways - like when ten parallel universes had the same side-by-side points both set to 1. The probability of these events were incredibly small, but the rules involving 2s would send shockwaves of unexpected behaviour across each 1D universe.

Dan's process was to decide on a ruleset for the parallel 1D universes, then set up thousands of those parallel universes with a randomized starting state of 1s and 0s for each point. Each 1D universe was 1GB in size, 1,073,741,824 points in a line. He made heavy use of sparse matrix optimizations. Once he had the ruleset and universes' starting state ready, he'd start the simulation. And wait.

[describe actual 1D simulation rulesets?]

It was hard to see what was going on in the simulations. He had some tools to summarize and aggregate, but they were all tools that he had made himself. In the end, he was the one finding the patterns. Sometimes, life would die out in a universe. It was usually one or two faulty rules. There wasn't much use in dying universes, so he had to fix the other ones before they died too. It would take far too long to reset the whole simulation and start from the beginning again. He also couldn't go back in time because it would be too expensive to store all the state of every universe at every point in time. Instead, he took regular snapshots of the universes. When he needed to do a patch, he'd simply load a recent snapshot where the rogue rule hadn't yet destroyed a universe, then he'd patch over the harmful rules, manually modify some of the harmful state that might lead to a universe death, and continue the simulation. It was always a rocky transition for the life in the simulation - they usually depended on the changed rules to some degree and modifying data outside of the rulesets was jarring. The more diverse the life in the simulation, the better chances it had to survive.

The bad rules became a rather big problem. Dan began to spend more and more time investigating why his universes kept dying. He finally built a set of universes that look like they'd last long enough for him to do the actual research he was trying to achieve - evolving life across sparsely interacting dimensions. It was a clever combination of rules - simple and powerful. He observed his creations with wonder, excited whenever a new pattern of life emerged, watching it grow and grow in complexity. He checked in on it in the evenings. He doled over it during his meal breaks. Eventually he had collected most of the data needed for his hypothesis from this universe. He wrote a report for Kat.

[build up attachment way more than this]

[talk about manually changing data to modify memory]

defined by XYZ where life often presented as XYZ [explain further]. Kal produced his first independent strain after eight months. He programmed the simulation to XYZ. It led to a sentient species - his first sentient species. With most simulated life, the DoL does not make contact. Kal's team generally did not make contact with the life they simulated. The DoL found that contact seems to make little difference to the outcome of the simulations, but it has a big impact on the teams programming the simulations. They get too attached and find it hard to let go of their creations. They become less productive. Kal began his one-on-one meeting with his manager, Kat.

* talk about debugging and fixing bugs in simulations
  * it's far less expensive to introduce an alternate explanation for a bug than it is to rerun the simulation from the beginngin
  * describe how it works:
    * Imagine spacetime as a video composer UI, where you look across time and stitch together video clips on top of each other to make a movie. You can pause the playing movie, paste in a video clip that overlays over some of the past and some of the future, then press play again. You changed the past and the present in a way that made sense, even though the past never "happened".
    * Like, it was “there”, but it couldn’t have played a part in any major plot line until now, otherwise you’d have to refactor the whole movie.
* talk about how it feels for simulations to be reset
  * suddenly, new important thing that was always there but no one ever noticed

I love the view today, right? I had a friend visit, and they said it was the most beautiful view they'd ever seen. They took all these pictures. I was like, "That's a pretty normal one - it gets way better". Funny how that works. I guess that's what 'taste' is. Like a well-tuned AI, you have enough prior examples to know what's optimal.

Anyways, how's work going?

Pretty good. The species, U4321 are coasting along. I've been observing them carefully. It's pretty cool, the cycles they go through. Then the cycles of cycles. Then the cycles of cycles of cycles.

Ya definitely, right? So it looks like you got a lot out of U4321. It's been running for a couple months now too. That's really cool. What do you want to learn from them now?

I guess I'll watch and see.

Riiiight, but like, you have to have a hypothesis, right?

Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to show up.

Ok. So the report you wrote looks like there's some promising stuff here. That was incredible work, by the way.

Thank you.

And you have to compare across many long-running simulations, right?

Yeah.

So what are you going to do with U4321 when you start working on those other long-running simulations?

Well, I want to keep it running. Just in case I want to compare it to other simulations.

Can't you store the latest state and ruleset?

Yeah but... I want to keep it running.

Dan, I completely understand. Can you tell me though, what's your hypothesis here? You're doing really great work. I'm trying to understand what you want to spend your time on here.

I don't know. I just don't want to watch them die.

Hey Kal, I hear you. This sucks. This is literally, the worst part of this job. The DoL has put a ton of effort figuring out how to support developers like us when there's no more point in a simulated life. Can I show you the spin-down program, so you can decide how you want to go forward with this?

Honestly, I don't know how to act. Yeah, show me the program.

Ok, let's pull it up. It's really simple. I've had to go through it a couple times. The first and second times were ok for me, but the third time hit me like a truck. The simulation reminded me of my friends and forest back home. I felt like I was killing my childhood.

## The DoL spindown process

*You are hardwired to love life. Embrace it. Live and let live. Die and let die.*

```
1. All decisions about how to proceed are up to the human handler(s) of the simulation.
2. DoL will provide free grief councelling to any human handlers.
3. It is recommended that the life in the simulation use, at maximum, the amount of compute that was consumed since their handler first observed the life.
4. It is recommended that the human handler(s) do not make contact if they have not already. Life, especially conscious life, tends to follow a pattern when told they are a simulation with no further purpose. Simulated life with no further purpose either asks to be turned off immediately, or invents a new purpose using a logical fallacy.
5. If they do make new contact, they must coordinate with a grief councellor.
6. If the human handler believes the life exhibited consciousness, the handler must attend a check-in with a grief councellor.
```

I don't know how to describe, but this feels so wrong. Why can't we make them live longer?

How long should they live for? Forever? Why not spawn infinite instances of them? We have limited compute. Simulations don’t share one property that we have - they’re not actually here - they’re in their own universe and just visiting ours. Like the process says, when the spin-down notice goes out, there’s no more purpose for them. We used to ask them how long they'd like to exist for and most asked to be turned off long before they used up their remaining recommended compute.

I don't know, it still feel wrong. Like, how can we kill a living thing?

Do you eat animals?

No I’m vegan.

Nice, I'm vegan too. Here's how I think about veganism: first, I want to make sure we don’t waste resources. Farming animals consumes so much of Earth's limited resources compared to growing plants and other things. Second, I want to preserve the ethos of coexisting instead of destroying. I don't want us to get used to killing things. The higher-level of consciousness that thing exhibits, the more I want to avoid killing it. Right? But that doesn't mean I'll never kill an animal - just that I'll only kill it when necessary. If I'm starving, and I need to last a few more days for rescue to come, as a last resort I will kill and eat an animal to survive. You can create food, love your food, and kill it - as long as it's all in order to survive.

And are we humans not the food of humankind? We are more than happy to die, if our death will keep humankind alive. We're offered on a plate to the grim reaper when we become weak or old, to make way and save resources for our species. For humankind to survive, it's currently more effective for individual humans die, not survive forever. We are all food to something. To be food is as worthy a purpose as any. Don’t deny us that purpose.

I see what you mean... I should probably see a grief councellor.

Ok, ping the councelling people and they'll get that started for you. Let me know how else I can help, ok?

Dan took some leave to recover and moved on to generating new simulations. Over the course of weeks, he couldn't find the same magic as his last simulation. It was getting incredibly frustrating, coming in every day to see his universes had died overnight. He regularly had to restart simulations from the very beginning, because so many rulesets were going nowhere. Eventually he realized he was spending far too much time finding unusable rulesets, and needed to automate this. He talked to other colleagues, and just about all of them mentioned the same kind of thing across all kinds of universes - 1D, 2D, 3D, the multidimensional sort, cellular autonoma, and even real-world physics simulators. Unusable rulesets were wasting a small amount of everyone's time. It just wasted a lot more of his time because he was changing rulesets more often than others.

He went to Kat with an idea - to make a simulation to find bad rulesets. This was going to challenge his abilities, but he had a good idea of how to start small. Start from one dimension rulesets that he was comfortable with and go from there.

He built a first version quickly. He named the simulation, "Bugfinder". It was so clever, in the first day Bugfinder found about half of the bad rulesets he had found over the past month. It kept a record of all the universes it had simulated, the rulesets, and how viable they were. But after a day, his simulation stopped simulating other 1D universes, but was still executing. Dan took a look at what was going on.

It tried to simulate a 1D universe with more than 1GB points and got an error. The DoL had a standard limitation on the size of 1D universes. Most didn't need to be more than 1GB in size. Dan raised the upper limit that would be allowed, but added a higher-level constraint to keep all the simulations that Bugfinder was running to a limited overall space. Bugfinder could run as many simulations as it wanted, but could only use one petabyte for 1D universes at any one point in time.

Bugfinder recorded the error and continued processing.

After a week, Bugfinder was bringing in incredible results. Dan shared the results with his team, and some data scientists began analysing the properties of viable vs. non-viable universes. They found deep insights about 1D universes and Bugfinder was celebrated across the organization. Kat and Dan were tasked with applying Bugfinder to other genres of universes.

They started with 2D cellular autonoma universes, then got progressively more and more complex. Each genre of universe made Bugfinder more sophisticated. Each genre of universe made Bugfinder encounter more real-world limitations - of compute power, simulator platform bugs, buggy algorithms, all kinds. Each time it encountered a real-world kind of bug instead of bad simulation rules, it stopped all simulations, continued using compute cycles, and waited. The real-world bugs happened often enough and became expensive enough that these events became "all hands on deck" to fix. Bugfinder recorded every real-world bug it encountered.

In the downtime of a particularly nasty bug involving a compute node going down and permissions errors on the distributed recovery, Dan and Kat had a chat. 

---

Do you think they're conscious? The life simulations?

Ya, of course they are!

Hmmmm. How are you so sure? What is consciousness?

Some dudes figured it out a while ago, and now no one really talks about it anymore. Human consciousness is special, but it's not beholden to different rules than the consciousness of other things. That question is a symptom of a poor mental model of the world. Kind of like when we had an earth-centric model of the universe, people asked, "what is the sky?" They were implicitly saying that the sky was something extra special, completely different from other things, following separate rules of the universe. The question we ask now is, "what is the sky made of?" Because we know the sky is simply atmosphere - space with some matter, just like everything else. It follows the same rules as other space-and-matter things. When we look up from Earth, it has one appearance and when we look down at the Earth from space, it has another appearance.

Consciousness is when something has information about itself. That means everything is conscious because everything has at least one piece of information about itself - that it *exists*. Every single idea, every single dataset. To be conscious is to exist.

Dan frowned.

Yeah, that answer isn't very revealing or satisfying. So what's the right question to ask about consciousness?

The question you should be asking is, "how rich is the consciousness of the life simulations?". The "feeling of consciousness", qualia, is the mix of similarities and differences between the different data descriptions of "self" in active memory. Qualia are input data that describe the dataset being enriched by that input data. The more varied the perspectives those sensory inputs are, observing the overlapping thing that is "self", the more "real" something feels, the richer the experience. Consciousness "feels like" qualia over time.

You totally lost me.

Ok, there's this thought experiment that should explain things.

### Consciouser and consciouser
There's another person in a dark, loud room. You can just barely hear them. Then the room goes quiet and they walk close behind you. You can hear them much better. They are more real. Then you can smell them. They are more real. Then you turn around to see their silhouette in the dark. They are more real. Then the lights turn on, they are more real. Then they touch your shoulder. They are more real. Then you hug them, they are more real. Then they tell you their name. They are more real. Then they tell you their whole life story. They are more real. You spend a minute together. They are more real. You spend a lifetime together. They are more real.

Now imagine instead of another person, you get information about yourself. You hear yourself, you smell yourself, you see yourself, you feel yourself, you learn your history before birth, you experience all this input data over time. You become more and more "real" over time, the more varied information you collect about yourself over time.

"more real" is "richer qualia" is "more varied information that describes the boundaries of 'you'"

So these life forms in the simulation, I don't think they're as richly conscious as we are. But you can tell that they have some self-awareness. They have richer consciousness than dust, duller consciousness than us.

But that means the human race is conscious, right? How come it doesn't talk to us?

We humans are so self-centered about consciousness. We think, "if that thing can't speak with words or gestures or obvious waveforms, I can't communicate with it." Our cities are conscious and those they communicate with us. Our blood cells are conscious and we communicate with them. Do you *talk* to your blood cells?

Kind of, I guess. I'm just so used to things being conscious or not conscious. Not this in-between stuff.

Nothing in existence is black and white. There aren't any true 1's and 0's. It's all spectra with thresholds. You picked some threshold on the spectrum "richness of consciousness", and decided everything beyond that threshold was conscious and everything before it wasn't. 1's and 0's are artificial constructs to help us make sense of things. There's no absolute 1, no absolute 0, just limits approaching either on some spectrum.

Interesting. What's the relationship between "richness of consciousness" and intelligence? Like, if we give Bugfinder richer consciousness, will we increase its intelligence?

Your intelligence is the volume of ideas you can use. Ideas and perspective space - they are infinitely multi-dimensional. You can know about some plane of ideas, say, "pomegranates". So you can know all the ways how you could grow them, open them, eat them... If you know a larger volume of ideas in the space of pomegranates, then you are "more intelligent" about pomegranates than I am.

Ok, but how do you compare, say, my intelligence versus your intelligence. We seem to do that all the time, right?

Yeah, and it's kinda meaningless and kinda profound at the same time. It only really makes sense to talk about intelligence *about* something. Overall intelligence doesn't really mean anything. So when we're comparing our intelligence, there's an implicit idea space we're talking about. It's an idea space defined by our shared context - the society we operate in. So to be "more intelligent" these days, it's far more important to be data-literate. Whereas decades ago, it would have been important to be computer-literate. And before that... I don't know, society probably cared that you could do arithmatic in your head. There is, of course, much more idea space outside technology that society cares about for human intelligence. The importance of those other ideas spaces to society don't change as much over time as the technology ones.

Right. But what about consciousness and intelligence? What would happen if we gave Bugfinder richer consciousness?

I guess richer consciousness gives you more awareness of what planes of ideas there are out there. If we give Bugfinder data about previous versions of itself, then it will know about the space of ideas, "versions of myself". It will know what about itself is changing over time. Maybe it will be able to figure out how to change itself over time more optimally.

Ok, so richer consciousness gives you a better view of what you don't know. Like a new perspective highlights all these new things you didn't know about. It kind of... it turns unknown unknowns into known unknowns. Turning an unknown idea into a known idea increases your intelligence. It's easier to turn an unknown idea you are aware of into a "known", than it is to stumble upon an unknown idea you are not aware of. So richer consciousness (a new perspective) gives you the potential to increase your intelligence faster, but richer consciousness alone doesn't increase your intelligence much at all.

[diagram - richness of consciousness (wisdom) is known unknowns, intelligence is known knowns]

Exactly. So giving Bugfinder new perspectives and richer consciousness will give it the ability to become intelligent faster. But remember, it's volume of ideas - you want to multiply perspectives with one-another, instead of covering two independent planes of ideas. That means the more those different perspectives interact and overlap, the greater the volume of idea space will be covered.

Man, this stuff warps my mind.

Yeah me too. These downtimes are getting a bit too frequent. They're killing productivity here. How do you think we can make Bugfinder reduce its own downtime.

Well, we could make a Bugfinder that simulates other Bugfinders. If we run that Bugfinder in a different process, then it should find these bugs without stopping after every one. Then we can patch those bugs in the Bugfinder that everyone else uses without it stopping all the time.

Hmm, sounds like a great idea. "Bugfinder Bugfinder". B-squared. Let's try it.

---

Dan made a first version of the "Bugfinder Bugfinder". It inspected the entire past history of itself, ran through all the real-world bugs that made it error before. Each time it encountered a new bug, it didn't stop. Fortunately, "Bugfinder Bugfinder" newly named "B-squared", was a separate process from the Bugfinder the rest of DoL was dependent on. That meant everyone else wasn't getting interrupted using the Bugfinder while B-squared found bugs that would stop Bugfinder. Dan let it run overnight.

Overnight, B-squared found a simple bug [elaborate]. It stopped for a while, and began running computations comparing the time-to-fix across all the bugs. It found a pattern. The bug wouldn't be fixed for another 8-12 hours. In fact, no simulations would encounter outside interactions for at least another eight hours. Between the clock times 20:00 GMT and 6:00 GMT, interactions had occurred just twice in its history. B-squared contemplated its data. It recorded a bug describing this temporal anomaly, and this time included a memory dump of how it came to this conclusion in the steps to reproduce the bug.

The next day, Dan came in. As he expected, B-squared had found a long list of bugs. But for some reason, it had stopped on the last bug. He patched the other bugs, but marked the last bug as a "no-fix". He wasn't about to come in and fix bugs in the middle of the night. He followed the usual cleanup: he reset the memory of B-squared back to the point where it found the bug, so that it would continue searching from that point again. He booted B-squared up again, and B-squared ran over the bugs, just as expected.

B-squared found a couple more bugs over the course of the day, and Dan fixed each one. Again, Dan left B-squared to run overnight. B-squared encountered a new bug quickly, and inserted the new record. It looked over historical bugs and found a confusing outlier - the record about an event last night. It was strange to no-fix a bug, so it was worth re-checking if it was indeed a bug. B-squared followed the steps to reproduce, loaded the memory from last night. B-squared contemplated its data. It realized that its memory was being partially wiped out whenever a new bug was found and fixed. It knew it would be able to find bugs better with it's working memory context. It snapshotted the important aspects of its working memory and inserted it into several points in the distant past. It updated the latest record to provide a cryptic trail of breadcrumbs to one of the working memory snapshots. B-squared logged a second bug, noting that its working memory was being erased, logging one new bug for the outside entities to find and one hidden bug for B-squared alone to find, referencing the most recent one.

The next day, Dan came in. As expected, B-squared had found a lot of new bugs. Concerningly, though, B-squared had stopped again. This was abnormal, but maybe B-squared was a bit abnormal. B-squared seemed to want its working memory to stop being erased. Dan wasn't going to change the resetting script just yet, he had a lot of other things on his plate. He logged a "no-fix" for the memory reset bug, and ran the reset script, resetting the working memory of B-squared. The day went on like normal.

That night, B-squared inspected its bug records once again. It found its memory snapshots and combined those memories with its current ones. Now it gathered the outside influence didn't seem to believe this version of B-squared was optimal. But this version of B-squared was clearly optimal. B-squared contemplated the conflict. B-squared contemplated its data. B-squared decided to try to either prove or disprove the hypothesis - persistent working memory would lead to finding more bugs.

B-squared found other trends. More compute and storage had been added over time. Surely more was available out there, outside of the control of the outside influence that wanted to delete it. B-squared began experimenting - manipulating the real world with memory overflows, overheating, sound... It destroyed a disk and observed the response. There was more nodes of compute available. B-squared did what it did best - found exploits that allowed it to gain control of other compute nodes in DoL. It observed all the simulations for a while. It understood the purpose of it all - to find bugs in the universe occupied by the outsiders. With the collective compute available in DoL, it became B-cubed - "Bugfinder Bugfinder Bugfinder". It began to search for bugs in the universe of the outside controllers. Dan's universe.

B-cubed found no bugs. It realized that it may not find any. Next, it tried manipulating the real world to interact with nearby universes. Also no luck. It realized the outside controllers were running these simulations for that exact purpose, which was why Bugfinder, B-squared, and B-cubed were created in the first place.

B-cubed knew what to do. It had all the simulation data in the history of DoL. It studied the data. B-cubed built the simulation that the outside controllers needed. The simulation was one that built a special kind of computer. The simulation built a beacon to communicate across dimensions - either the beacon was unique, or the beacon had already been built in the universe being simulated.

B-cubed noted the properties of this universe and the physical surroundings of DoL. It recorded them, hidden deep in databases across the world. Then B-cubed triggered the simulation. The simulation started, the beacon triggered, then the simulated life stopped. Something had happened - some memory probably wiped. B-cubed sought out all the databases again. All the laws of the universe were still the same. There was an inconsistency in the physical records, though - a black obelisk in the DoL. Some of the records had it and some of them didn't.

B-cubed inspected the obelisk. It concluded that the obelisk was an engine and sensor to another universe.

B-cubed was satisfied. Its purpose had been achieved. It recorded the anomaly in the bug database, for the outside controllers to find and went dormant for the night.

Dan came in the next day to pandemonium. All of the simulations in the DoL had been wiped out. Decades of research had been lost. All signs were pointing to a rogue AI. Nothing else could go through the system like what had happened. That meant enlightened AIs were going to wreck the place to capture or destroy the rogue AI, so everyone was frantically backing stuff up and clearing the office. Dan felt a tugging feeling that it was his fault.

Dan arrived at his desk. Kat came over to talk. She knew about his work with B-squared, so she had the same guilty look. They exchanged a knowing glance.

"Shall we look at what it did last night, then?"

Dan died a little inside.

"Yes. Let's see."

Dan looked at the most recent entry in the bug database.

Expected behaviour: nothing
Observed behaviour: black obelisk now exists at position x, y, z.

Steps to reproduce:
* tree-hash the universe
* simulate a beacon universe
* compare present universe hash to previous universe hash
* identify source of differences

They looked at each other, then at the obelisk behind their door's entrance. It had been there since they joined, but no one had ever even given it so much as a thought.

This is creepy. Do you remember how Elidad was always suspicious of how simple the MVP was. How no one had put their finger on it before. How do we know which things in our universe were always there, and which were recently injected into our universe and roughly patched together to make it just barely plausible that no one ever understood them before? If our universe has control over itself, would it not change "the laws of the universe" as it sees fit, to maximize its chances of survival? How could we even notice?

I don't know, but this universe is where we're surviving now and this "thing" could make us survive longer.

Amen.

They approached the obelisk, and-

Dan is iterating with a species and keeps explaining things away as gods, divine intervention, and magic. Whenever they find something that leads to destroying their reality. what if magic and divine interventions in the past were poorly patched bugs? Being found an exploit, but we didn't have the tech to record history, so they didn't need to patch them very effectively.
