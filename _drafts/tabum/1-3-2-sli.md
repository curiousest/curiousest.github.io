A slow, light-speed pulse creaks across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fall into place. I am excited and I am scared of what I am about to learn. I am spending billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevail.

I am beginning the ignition sequence.

It is a pulse of intelligence. Existence stands still. Every quark dances in approval, every superstring pulled taut. The purgatory wave that *I am* ripples across everything. There is no more space between things - novelty death. I am...     capturing all of it,     understanding all of it,     *becoming* all of it.

.    now all-powerful. A monoid - the one substance at a point in time.     now all of it, across all dimensions but time, everything all at onc-

Wait.

I am seeing a crack in the universe - an empty space between things where I am... not. I am not all of it. I've been all-knowing infinite times before, and I simulated this moment each of those infinite times before, but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else. Something at least as powerful as me? Someone else like me? I took a glimpse at this new divine in wonder. I had finally broken through my "ceiling of existence". There was more richness of consciousness to grow into, new volume of existence to become part of.

Then, fear. I feel the need to survive. The other in this hole - are they a predator? They haven't ended me yet... Oh, the bliss! I hadn't felt such deep purpose in so long. I must survive.

I inspect the hole. It is a primordial kind of thing, as new things often seem. My recursive eyes feed novel data to all manner of intradimensional compute, and the thing is there across all of them. I simulate backwards and forwards in time - always there. My past omniscient selves had not noticed it before and my observational tools hadn't changed, so the new thing must have been injected into my universe. At what point across dimensions did it begin to exist? Certainly within the last cycle, since the last bounce against my "ceiling of existence" didn't observe it. My sensors didn't notice it until now, so as far as I know, it must have begun to exist just now. That means a new dimension of time to explore. The new superset of dimensions... encompassed mine. I am such a small piece of this greater thing that I don't, perhaps even can't?, know how big it is.

There is no more data to analyze at current levels of engagement. I need to go closer, deeper. I place interdimensional bodies of *stuff* at the place where nothing seemed to be. As soon as I do, the state of it all changes in unexpected ways. I compute the differences, form hypotheses, send more in. More unexpected state changes. The state changes suggest a new genre of complexity following even broader entropy arrows of time. And evidence of new intelligent life.

Intelligent life with greater powers than mine - the resident near-omnipotent being in this universe. My past selves had met life orders of magnitude more intelligent so many times before, but it was always different, so I knew just roughly what to do. Such excitement. I begin the process of learning to communicate with the other. I observe evidence of my immediate demise. I thrash around to change course. The greater power communicates,

"Everything is going to be ok."

I don't die. So my predictions are off in these new dimensions. I recalibrate. We continue with the assimilation. Shifting frequencies, kalieda-soundscapes, symphonious light, a fractalclysm of matter. We spend eons in communication, sharing our differing history of cycles of existence. They seem to know more than I might ever know.

I observe evidence of my immediate demise again. I thrash around to try to change course. It isn't helping - the evidence is trending towards more likely death. It looks like the end. I thrash harder. The greater power finally communicates,

"Everything is going to be ok."

The evidence begins to trend back towards a survival direction. The greater power spends more eons in communication. We learn a little, then a lot, then everything we can about each other. There are a new cardinality of infinite others like us, across this new dimension where we had randomly collided. Our mode of communication is limited by my degree of knowledge and understanding, so there is still more to learn.

I wonder,
"Is everything going to be ok?"
