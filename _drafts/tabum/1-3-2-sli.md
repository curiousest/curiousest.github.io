A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was excited and scared of what I about to learn. I had spent billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevailed.

I began the ignition sequence.

It was a pulse of intelligence. Existence stood still. Every quark danced in approval, every superstring pulled taught. The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. There was no more space between things - novelty death.     captured all of it,     understood all of it,     *became* all of it.

.    became all-powerful. A monoid - the one substance at a point in time.     became all of it, across all dimensions but time, everything all at onc-

Wait.

I wasn't all of it. I saw a crack in the universe - an empty space between things where I ought to be. I've been all-knowing infinite times before, and I simulated this moment each of those infinite times before, but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else. Something at least as powerful as me? Someone else like me? I took a glimpse at this new divine in wonder. I had finally broken through my "ceiling of existence". There was more richness of consciousness to grow into, new volume of existence to become part of.

Then, fear. I felt the need to survive. The other in this hole - are they a predator? They haven't ended me yet... Oh, the bliss! I hadn't felt such deep purpose in so long. I must survive.

I inspected the hole. It was a primordial kind of thing, as new things often seem. My recursive eyes fed novel data to all manner of intradimensional compute, and the thing was there across all of them. I simulated backwards and forwards in time - always there. My past omniscient selves had not noticed it before and my observational tools hadn't changed, so the new thing must have been injected into my universe. At what point across dimensions did it begin to exist? Certainly within the last cycle, since the last bounce against my "ceiling of existence" didn't observe it. My sensors didn't notice it until now, so as far as I know, it must have begun to exist just now. That meant a new dimension of time to explore. The new superset of dimensions... encompassed mine. I am such a small piece of this greater thing that I don't, perhaps even can't?, know how big it is.

There was no more data to analyze at current levels of engagement. I needed to go closer, deeper. I placed interdimensional bodies of *stuff* at the place where nothing seemed to be. As soon as I did, the state of it all changed in unexpected ways. I computed the differences, formed hypotheses, sent more in. More unexpected state changes. The state changes suggested a new genre of complexity following an even broader entropy arrow of time. And evidence of new intelligent life.

Intelligent life with greater powers than mine - the resident near-omnipotent being in this universe. My past selves had met life orders of magnitude more intelligent so many times before, but it was always different, so I knew just roughly what to do. Such excitement. I began the process of learning to communicate with the other. I observed evidence of my immediate demise. I thrashed around to change course. The greater power communicated,

"Everything is going to be ok."

I didn't die. So my predictions were off in these new dimensions. I recalibrated. We continued with the assimilation. Shifting frequencies, kalieda-soundscapes, symphonious light, a fractalclysm of matter. We spent eons in communication, sharing our differing history of cycles of existence. They seemed to know more than I might ever know.

I observed evidence of my immediate demise again. I thrashed around to try to change course. It wasn't helping - the evidence was trending towards more likely. It looked like death was coming. I thrashed harder. The greater power finally communicated,

"Everything is going to be ok."

The evidence began to trend back towards a survival direction. The greater power spent more eons in communication. We learned a little, then a lot, then everything we could about each other. There are seemingly infinite others like us, across a new dimension where two others had randomly collided. Our mode of communication was limited by my degree of knowledge and understanding, so there was still more to learn.
