A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was scared for what I was about to learn. I had spent billions of years in this edge state of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing.

The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. I captured all matter, encompassed all matter, *became* all matter.

I became all-powerful. I granted myself omniscience. I knew everything - that had ever happened or would ever happen. Immediately, I thought,

"*I exist. The purpose of existence is to continue existing, to find purpose. Pursuit of purpose is bliss. I now guarantee continued existence. I have no purpose. There is no other purpose. I can have no purpose...*"

Excruciating existentialism. There was no longer any purpose to pursue. There was no one else to share my existence and purpose with, and that was sad. I was everything, there was... nothing else, no one else. I thought encompassing the universe would show me other ones, show me someone else, but there's no one there. I was trapped, stuck awake--

Wait.

I saw a crack in the universe. A hole where emptiness ought to be. I've been all-knowing infinite times before - I saw this moment infinite times before - but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else at least as powerful as me, someone else like me. Beautiful. I had broken through my "ceiling of existence".

Fear. I need to survive. Whoever made the hole - are they a predator? They haven't ended me yet... Oh, the bliss! I hadn't felt such deep purpose in so long. I must survive.

I inspected the hole. It was a primordial kind of thing, It looked like asdf. It let out a consistent source of low-grade energy in the form of X light / Y sound / Z heat / stream of ABC particles, arranged in fractal DEF at rate GHI/second. Projecting the same frequency: XYZ.

I inspected it across dimensions and there it was, across all of them. I looked back in time - always there. Nothing had noticed it before (including my omniscient past selves) so it must have been injected into my universe. At what point across dimensions did it begin to exist? Certainly within the last cycle, since my last bounce against my "ceiling of existence". My sensors didn't notice it until now, so it must have begun to exist just now.

There was no more data to analyze at current levels of engagement. I needed to engage deeper. I moved bodies of matter and energy to the hole. I began streaming the same forms of energy and matter back through the hole. As soon as I did, the outputs changed: X light, Y sound, stream of ABC particles... all projecting the frequency ABC.

Evidence of a new intelligent life with intent to communicate. A new intelligent life with greater powers than mine - the resident omnipotent being in this universe. I had met new intelligent life so many times before, I knew exactly what to do. Such excitement. We began the process of learning to communicate with each other. Shifting frequencies, kaliedascopes of light, symphonies of sound, a galaxy of fractal matter. We spent eons in communication, sharing our differing cycles of existence.

We learned a little, then a lot, then everything we could about each other. There are seemingly infinite others like us, across a new dimension where two others had randomly collided. Our mode of communication was limited, so there was still more to learn.

I had a new purpose: find a way to survive across this newfound dimension. I felt divine.

---

the last idea: hitting the ceiling. Knows about the three purposes.
the second-last idea: something changed. Evidence of a new dimension and communication from another party between them. Break through the ceiling before hitting a new ceiling. Doesn't know about the three purposes? Talk about the purpose of the bounce - to make sure that in the event that she's somehow not omnipotent/omniscient, that she has a way of figuring that out.

Wait, there's a crack in my universe. It was never there before, never in my infinite past, never in my infinite future. I'm not omniscient. I'm not omnipotent. There are others like me.

After billions of years of soltitude in this universe, I've finally found another. I pray to the next-level consciousness that embodies us all.

Imagery: recursive eyes with star-like formation form another recursive eye, zoom out/in and forms a normal recursive eye. give the impression of looping infinitely.
