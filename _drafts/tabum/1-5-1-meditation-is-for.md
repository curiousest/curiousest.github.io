#### Meditation is for self-improvement - exploring new mental states

[relatable story, especially start]
[mattering is the appendix of the mind. Stopping existential crisis like burst appendix. It’s not yet clear what it’s for, and when it violently ruptures, it can mean the end of you without immediate attention ]
Breathe in.

A sheet of block-protein machinery tightened and flattened itself, pulling on all its tethers to stretch three hundred million spongy air sacs. The stretching pressure sucked in a mix of twenty percent fruit and eighty percent non-consumables. Before all the goodies filled the tubular air sacs, the mix went through a vent where it was warmed, humidified, and filtered. Once inside, the fruits in the mix nestled against the walls of the tree of tubes, ripe for harvest. Wine-coloured workers gathered all around the tree to pick the fruit in social union. They picked fruit until their baskets were full, then floated through the mass transport system and carried the fruit all across transport-connected space to personally feed the hungry. From each worker according to their limited capacity, to each consumer according to their bounded hunger.

The system worked.

Dan was sitting, staring at a dot on the wall, preparing.

Breathe out.

A river of white-light photons hit the dot on the wall. The dye molecules in the dot absorbed the wavelengths of light from the violet/blue end of the spectrum. The rest of the light reflected all around the room, some of it piercing a transparent sheet into a pair of caves - one of the places where fruit was delivered. A gathering of conic and cylindrical workers stood at the back of each cave, chained to the wall. The chained workers consumed their own portion of the light. Each worker whispered their interpretations of the light into a line where a network of designated light-interpreters looked across all the light interpretations to produce a unified understanding. They preached their understanding - the dot. But everyone else had stopped listening to the light-interpreters. Everyone else cared about what the light-interpreters had to say when it was adapted to the present, and what they said had stopped making sense a long time ago. Change is both how and what everyone saw. The light-interpreters had stared too long at this unchanging light, while everyone else had stared too long into the dark, and now they were all blind. The unified understanding of the light burned blindingly bright with irrelevance. All that was left was the dot - the singular obsession of the light-interpreters and the last reminder that there used to be more to the light than the dot on the wall.

The system wasn't working. It was being hacked.

Dan's eyes were open, but he couldn't see anything, like his eyes had gone numb. Just the dot on the wall. He closed his eyes.

Breathe in.

Sight went to sleep. Taste, smell, and sound were already sleeping too. Touch was the only one awake. An old and grounded sensation, who was usually drowned out by all the others and rarely drove the system’s focus. Touch steered focus to *the breath*. Light pressure on nostrils, a little moisture stolen from the throat, slight stretch of the lungs. Belly muscles pushed out, chest motionless while the belly expanded. Focus was exploring too many things, so touch pulled focus to a tighter leash: top of the upper lip. Grazed. Then no sensation. Brushed. Then no sensation. Ghoasc - some other sensation lost in translation as focus wandered forwards to the space in front of the upper lip. Empty. It felt peaceful. Then the space in front of that, and in front of that, and in front of that… The forward-going space kept on giving peace to focus, but the ever-expanding forwards was beginning to feel… Something in self was trending towards infinity. "That way is unknown." Touch said, gently guiding focus back to *the breath*. Top of the lower lip. Moisture drying. Top of the lower lip. Pulse... Pulse.

The system worked.

Dan sat motionless for another forty minutes.

Breathe out.

Touch went to sleep and so focus lost its last link to reality. A touch-bright brain was floating in the nothing. Ego in a vat.

Dan felt a shock of excitement. Finally, an opportunity to gather exotic experiential data. He silenced his excitement so it didn't scare away his brainstate.

Ego in a vat, the exotic brainstate. It felt like proprioception of his brain floating around in vacuum. Blue-white in touch-colour, with no sound. Weightless. His mind's eye looked down and then there were two hands, the same touch-colour but a little less bright. He saw them through touch, disconnected and floating apart from his mind along a dimension without length. The length of nothing is either unknowable or infinite - two physiologically synonymous terms. There was nothing between his separated hands and head, so it was unknowably far away. So it felt infinitely far away. A new exotic brainstate - infinite rayman.

The system wasn't working. It was being hacked.

Dan was sparked with excitement again. He imagined a crowd celebrating him and his achievements. Imagined a podium with someone speaking about him. He imagined it was a funeral speech, listing all his worldly accomplishments. His family and friends were there, so much love. But he was dead, so sad. He felt his inner-right tear duct pump salt water into a budding droplet attached to his right sticky globe. Volume built up until the tear's surface tension collapsed under its own weight and cried gravity-wards. What's the minimum cry-able object? An eye can cry. A tear duct? Does a tear cry?

Dan caught himself. All his senses had woken up. He yelled at himself internally. He was just about to collect more exotic brainstates, but ego-tripping got him caught up in useless sentimental garbage. There were much better samples of funeral experiential data in real life. At least he collected the exotic brainstates, "ego in a vat" and "infinite rayman". This was only the third time he'd experienced "infinite rayman".

Dan’s mind woke up his sleeping body, who hooked himself up to his DayDreamEATer - an experience authoring tool. He wanted to produce something close to the exotic brainstates he had just felt. Audio wasn't expressive enough, neither was video, so he needed to produce a sentio. The DayDreamEATer read some echoes of his sensory input sequences and notable brainstate transitions, then produced a first-draft sentio thick with sensory deprivation and two major focus transitions. Dan fleshed out the sensory focus using prompts made of recalled touch-feel from his memory, especially targeting the "ego in a vat" to "infinite rayman" transition. He had already modelled "ego in a vat" a few times, so he didn't need to elaborate on that buildup any more.

He played the sentio back. For a moment, all senses were wide awake - Dan felt the inoffensive boot-up sound, smell, taste, sight, touch, mixed with other supplementary senses. Then all of them were silenced for a few moments. Touch was set free to feel and set focus on the upper lip just long enough to forget that the other senses were still there. Touch went quiet too and focus disconnected from anything human. A dull brainy mouth-feel floated in a massive empty warehouse. Focus moved forward to the other end of the warehouse and two hands came to be. Brain hundreds of meters from hands in the warehouse.
[make sentio more casual and less immersive, while still involving all senses. think, mobile device. What would exotic brainstates be casually useful for?]

Then it ended. Back to reality, where Dan was hooked up to the DayDreamEATer.

Close, but not quite there. He'd need to feel it a couple more times to paint more concise strokes of experience and get the sentio feeling closer to what he actually felt. These things were never perfectly replicable, but the more realistic, the better. Focus didn't have to move forward to set the floating hand positions, maybe he just needed to-

A notification tapped his shoulder and whispered, “meeting starting now”. Dan let out a big sigh. Meditation break over. He got up off his bed and went to his work space. He had a morning work meeting that had been scheduled last-minute.

---

[include dans reactions to all this, so empathy built up]
Dan joined the virtual conference in social union. Around a hundred people. A *wrong* hundred. He scanned the list of names as everyone waited for synchronized presence. A mix of junior, mid, and senior staff. A couple directors whose roles he didn't understand. Some people he didn't like or respect and some people he liked quite a bit. This group shouldn't be together.

Sight and sound softened, signalling that social synchronization had been achieved and it was time to start. A senior executive took focus. He wore a button-up shirt, a neutral expression, and the company's values. On the scale from corporate monkey to grease monkey, he was looking rather ape. Just another dude making his way through life.

"There is no easy way to say this," the executive said, like he'd practiced a couple times in front of a broken mirror to unbreak it,
"your roles are being made redundant from today."

A pause. Another person took focus alongside the senior executive. Hair black and dense and long all the way to a sweater with the same colour and consistency, forming a solemn black hood. The light was coming from up and behind, face shadowed under the black hood.

The executive continued,
"Our HR representative Charon is here to help us all through this. Because of legalities, I have to read from a script, so it's not exactly how I'd like to say these things, but this is how it's gotta be..."

He looked over to a visualization and began reading,
"Over the past two years we’ve seen dramatic change. Our corporate organizationism evolved to thrive in a different ecosystem than the world we face today."

Charon chanted,
"The leadership foresaw change, but they are not obligated to foresee all change."

The executive continued,
"I am confident our breed can still flourish thanks to the strength of our mission, the value of our products and services, and our incredibly talented people. For our lineage to continue, we need to make tough choices. So, we’ve reviewed all product areas and functions to ensure that our corporate anatomy is aligned with our hardy ambitions. All the rest must die. We've chosen you to die and now the idea of you working here is dead."

Charon chanted,
"Dearly redundant, we are gathered here today to transport you to your new reality. The legacy idea of you will live on through those who remain in the corporate plane. A separate service will be held with the living to commemorate you - the ideas we've lost. There will be no more corporeal co-mingling between you newly departed and the living vessels who remain. Question-lash-answers will now be taken to comfort you as we begin this transitional journey."

The Charon visualized the highest-ranked concerns of those on the call. She stood behind the executive and raised a cat-o-nine-tails. She read out the first question on the list,
"First question-lash-answer... I thought we were safe here."
Then she struck the executive on his back with the weapon to draw blood and answers.

The senior executive coughed in pain and answered,
"You are privileged, not protected - at worst you can find a job at a lower tier of employer in a month or two."

Charon looked at the new message and read,
"Second question-lash-answer... This organatomy refactor is suboptimal for my happiness. Why is this happening? We will be fighting this with lawyers."
She struck the executive again.

The senior executive flinched, then answered,
"Yes, it is suboptimal for all of us. I am responsible for the staffing overreach, and my punishment is to serve you these sentences. I know you would enjoy heavier punishment, but you are dead now. It weighs as hard on my heart as it does on your mind - half of my remaining humanity will be struck from my soul and I don’t have much left to begin with. Still, this refactor is the optimal path. Sometimes, to go forwards we must first step back - to succeed, I must be able to fail. We have to delete optimal functions of a suboptimal module. Most of you are not poor performers - just unfortunate ones."

Charon looked at the new message and read,
"Third question-lash-answer... For those of us on visas that let us to stay in this corporeal plane, what will you do for us? And what about healthcare?"
She struck the executive again.

The senior executive cried out in pain, then answered,
“Yes, we will help you bend the laws of this universe, but that’s just slowing your descent. You will have to latch on to a new organizationism to stay. Without a host, there’s no reason for you to be healthy or here.”

Charon struck the executive one last time and the executive cried out in pain, moaning longer and droning into a sigh now that his punishment had finished. Charon read,
"We give thanks for this penance. Now we meditate together in a collective closing prayer.”

She started slowly, so all in the conference could join in. Everyone had the flow of the chant down, if not the words.

```
Our Father,
Who art no pattern,
Everynothing be thy plane;
Thy signal come;
We are undone; reality is disproven.
Give us the questions without the answers;
and embrace our naivety as we embrace those whose naivety shapes us; 
and lead us not into devotion, nor deliver us from apathy.
```

"You are optimal."
Charon called.

"We are suboptimal."
The conference answered with a mumbling hum.

The executive continued to a conclusion,
"Ask Charon if you have any further questions, and she will acknowledge them. The answers you seek are on the other side. Goodbye."

The conference ended rather suddenly. Then it continued to end rather slowly, the moment stretched over a minute of brain-compute. Time was passing at a more variable rate than Dan had remembered. Maybe time always progresses unevenly and the part of the brain that smooths it out was dysfunctional. He was in shock.

Dan thought to himself,
"All my friends are here. I spend all my time here. Everything… my purpose is here. I felt settled."

#### Meditation is for self-awareness - debugging complex distributed brainsystems

[more relatable, fewer focused weird descriptions ]
Dan continued his day as normally as he could. But what do you do when what you do is gone? Certainly recompute from first principles - but what if your first principles died too?

Dan closed his eyes and was smothered in something familiar. An isolated awareness, which wasn't integrated with other data or sensation. An all-consuming awareness, approaching everynothing. It started as a low drone, the first slow iterations of loading a new optimization objective into memory. The old optimization objective was deleted, and a new one had to replace it. But the new one didn't fit - it was infinitely large and unknown. There were no alternatives to load. It was the beginning of compute-thrashing, the first iterations slow and measured. But with each failure, the task became more urgent and the attempts became more frantic. The sound became louder. It was the sound of his beliefs changing again - from something into nothing. Deletion. It said,

"Perhaps it's time now. You put it off long enough. Come or go. This isn't going anywhere. You - however - at some point you *will* come. This is inevitable."

[go deeper into describing feelings that beliefs are changing. why it would be useful. how there could be so many kinds of feelings about past or upcoming state changes in belief structures.]
[every piece of experiential data is a drug]

"Either I exist forever or I don't, forever."
Dan thought. A kind of nirvana overcast darkness on top of darkness.
"I'll either pursue the same purpose forever, or I'll keep changing my purpose. But they're both... the same... nothing."

Dan felt a physical "click" in his brain. Meaning-producer switched off. Or was it a "pop"? Whatever it was, it was followed by a low-intensity headache. Burning. Smouldering along a plane from his temples to the back corners of his skull.

Something felt inherently *wrong* with combining purpose and infinity - they don't compute. The optimization objectives of some thing as its span of existence approaches infinity - those objectives degrade to "unknown". Physiologically synonymous terms. Everything in this infinite universe is exactly unknown. So what goes there? An all-encompassing feeling of infinity - the unknown.

The closer he inspected it, the more it tore him apart. He had no purpose and the one purpose he could have wouldn't fit. This in-between mental state was rather fragile - must be unexplored. And fleeting - it couldn't be pursued. No one had made a map of how to get there. There was no sentio. Because once they reach it, they find there's no longer any point in anything, including explaining how to get there. How horribly exciting. Such exotic brainstates. What wonder.

His thought-processes absorbed that logic. Every belief is false. Even "true" and "false", "one" and "zero" - they’re spiritual phenomena. Overfitted classifications. Mere models. The "data about reality" we live by is based on sensors built by classifiers - another spiritual system. But "there is no truth" and "nothing really matters" were in conflict with every other belief in his brain. Brainburn smouldering of all newly false causal structures produced a hot entropy of data. Brains execute unexpected behaviours in such situations. The experiential data now contained in this brain is suboptimal for the survival of other humans around - family, friends, community. It's advantageous for this brain to die. There are grooves in the human brain to handle these circumstances.

His brainburn was steady, but the intensity of the overwhelming thrashing feeling grew. There was nowhere to go to change it - he was in his bedroom, place of peak comfort. "If I scream for help, no one could possibly hear." Dan thought. He screamed anyways. Excruciating unknown. He was dismantling all the belief-based structures in his mind. Screaming made it feel better though - it was a distraction. Any other mental computation felt better. He flailed and met the bed.
"Look - a bed! When I touch it, I feel it - how wonderful! I hit it to feel it, I feel it so I can hit it some more."
Emergent purpose. He channeled that distraction, hitting his bed until he regained some kind of normal. He attached himself to the first habit he could think of - media. He glued himself to audio, video, and sentio distractions for the rest of the day. Consuming all the life-saving trash medicinal data he could suck in through his sensory orifices.

When he was full of trash, he needed a next habit. His DayDreamEATer was still there. He hooked himself up and let it read traces from the last few hours. He chose not to relive the nihilist logical progression, continued concentrating on the task-at-hand and not its broader implications. A first draft sentio came out. Dan contributed prompts describing the logical progression. He also fine-tuned the brainburn sensation he was having with touch-feel prompts.

He played the sentio back. Dan felt the pleasant boot-up sound, smell, taste, sight, touch, mixed with other supplementary senses. It was hardly comforting at all anymore. Then it started. His hair was on fire. He hit a bed with his arms three times to make the fire go out. It went out, but he was burned.

Then it ended. Back to reality.

"Not even close. These must not be sentio-compatible experiences. The tools we have are nowhere near able to express this." Dan thought to himself.

Then it was dark out. His mind was still distracted. He prepared for sleep, turned off the lights. Then it was dark in. The empty kind of dark, raises the question - is there anything there? No sensory input signals. He clawed at the air in front of him. Nothing. He inhaled, no air. How could he know if there was anything there? It all felt like nothing. And then there was falling, falling that wouldn't stop, dissociating in the dark. His brain clawed at reality, but couldn't find another mode of information processing that made sense. Virtual reality? No - it would feel less real. Dream? No - the emptiness is too coherent. Augmented reality? No - no view of a reality to enhance. Media? No - absence of sight or sound. And too familiar to be death, right? Right...? Nothing else. Sorry - this is the real reality. No it isn't, there's no such thing... have to invent something new.

The idea of Dan almost died in his bed there. Barely attached to his ego, the last strand keeping it together was that "there is no purpose" is yet another false belief. He needed a distraction. Here - a bed! When I touch it, I feel it - how wonderful! He channeled that distraction until he could grab hold of real life. Hold on to any sensation. Back to the sensation of breath. He didn't know what would have been left in his mind when his ego died, but he was sure it wouldn't have been him. How interesting. Such exotic brainstates.

He couldn't go to sleep. His brain wouldn't let him, survival instincts kicking in. If he went to sleep there's a good chance someone else would wake up in the morning. He drifted off, just short of ego death, then startled awake. Again and again. For some forever-like amount of time. Mortal strobelight.

He slept. What is the purpose of sleep? A tool to turn off the feeling of *being* for awhile. But is it better to exist forever or to not exist forever? It's better to think about a different question. He slept a bit. He woke up displeased to be conscious again, but he wasn't so sure unconscious was any better. He needed a more formidable distraction. New tool.

For now, cling to habits. He hooked himself up to the DayDreamEATer, to capture last night's experiences. He had low expectations, so he didn't bother with any prompts.

Dan played the sentio back. He felt the pleasant boot-up senses. Then it was pitch black and he was falling. Proprioception had him spinning and by touch he felt a thick, soft stillness. He grabbed onto the soft thing for a moment, and it stopped the spinning fall, but he lost it and was falling again. When he began to feel numb from the falling, almost like it had stopped, it reversed and he felt like he was falling and spinning upwards, until falling upwards felt like it was falling downwards. And when that began to feel numb, he was flipped again. And again. And again.

Then it ended. Back to reality.

"That was actually decent." Dan thought to himself. But it was such a strange thing, the sentio being anything at all. Just an artificial sensory input sequence. Just some data. What a strange feeling - he felt it about everything. And he knew that there was something about the past day of feelings and experiences that was... important. It contained information he should pay attention to. There was probably some obviously optimal action to take next. He thought about *what to do next* for a bit, then he thought about how strange it is to have to think about *what to do next*. Isn't that what brains are supposed to do for you? His brain was supposed to automate this task - why did he have to do it manually?

That's it! Next, he should go to the Village Elder. The place to tend the vessels wherein decisions are made. So Dan performed his morning habits. So ridiculous, every habit was a performance of the universe, for the universe. Water. Brush teeth. Shower. Clothes. Pills. Food. Water. Directions, short walk, only fifteen minutes - go. What a silly little performance.

#### Meditation is for survival - medicine for dangerous data

Dan walked outside. The world had lost so many of its dimensions. Even trees. The “London plane” trees along the road were just trying to survive. A vast evolutionary line, ancestors imported from America and Asia, then enslaved here to look pretty and clean the air a little. Allowed to live the way they wanted to live, as long as the way they wanted to live was the way they're wanted to live. Otherwise… first warning disfigurement, then capital punishment. Clean air obviously useful for human survival, while cityscape beauty had more elaborate reasoning. Dan thought he could probably look closer at a tree to observe more dimensions, and he'd probably see the same singular pattern over and over. Trees. Just another something trying to survive.

Dan walked. He would look at a thing, deconstruct it to his reductive beliefs, then it lost all meaning. Dan walked on the brick-tiled walkway. The bricks wouldn't be here if they weren't useful. If there was something better, they'd be replaced. And the walkway too - if a road ought to be here, it would. Even the cool, humid air - if there was a stabler compound containing the same base elements, he'd be breathing that instead. Or not. He didn't exactly need to be here. Why exactly was he here, again? Ah, right - for the same reason as everything else. Like everything else, he was reducible to survival, which meant nothing in this infinite universe. He had lost all meaning.

Village Elder ahead, it was just one glass wall in a vertical lake of glass walls. Sunlight and wind swept up waves of curling reflections and refractions. It had a puddle-sized tile at the ground level and Dan stepped inside. Reception. No one there. It didn't look like anyone else was around because it didn't need to look like there was anyone else around. Instead, it felt like people were just about to be here. Things were just about to start and he was just about to be seen. Well-lit, sunlight pouring in, dynamic paintings on the walls, desk-drawers and standing cabinets half-open, platoon of chairs at attention. The room felt alive. A weekday 10am in the flesh, without the flesh. Behind a desk, there was a hallway of doors. Dan approached the desk and it visualized some instructions for him.

```
Hello Dan. Welcome back to your local Village Elder. Please go down the hall to the first room on the right. A Village Elder will be with you shortly.
```

He went around the desk, down the hall, opened the door, walked inside.

There was a solid black wooden desk, two caramel-coloured couch-chairs, a fluffy white carpet, and a brilliant-blue-tinted window. All stacked on top of each other. Postmodern totem-pole. They readjusted themselves, then the window hopped over to the wall, one of the couch-chairs leapt forwards towards Dan, and all the rest toppled over. The chair offered an arm inches away from his hand to touch. He reached down to pet. His hand sunk deep into softness before there was anything firm-to-touch. The couch-chair spun around behind him, slight pressure on his calves, and he sat down gently. Sunk, gently. He relaxed into it. All-encompassing softness that absorbed his mental bleeding. Warmth that slowed his brain-hell freezing over. The cushioning underneath him rose and sank with slow breaths. A big rise, then big sigh, couch-arms hugged him snug.

A few minutes went by. The door opened behind Dan and he heard a woman's voice, clear as vacuum.
"Hi there Caramel, you called me? Ohhh, I didn't know you started already. Such a PRODUCTIVE MEETING! Look at you taking care of our patient. Are you FACILITATING this meeting? Yes you are! Yes you are! Such a USEFUL MEETING."

Everything in the room pointed in her direction. The window dilated to let in happy sunshine. The couch-chair gripped Dan just a little tighter. The carpet flapped. The other chair shot across the room to nuzzle an arm against the standing woman. She tapped it with her palm approvingly and it bounced back to where it was before. Dan started to get up and the chair bumped him up to a standing position. He turned to the woman.

She was a fullness disguised as soul-sucking emptiness. Eyes blue-behind-green, absolute-white smile, and golden hair well past her shoulders. Nihilism-dealing medusa. A look that could shatter any ego and send the mind hurtling heart-first into the moment. Facial expression wearing the smiling scar of a thought, "Nothing really matters, so let's play the game of happiness." Looking far enough through her you'd hallucinate golden snakes. They're in her head. If the idea of her didn't commit the original sin, she at least caused it.

"Hi Dan-" she began, smiling soft as a cushion of air, "I'm Doctor K. And I see you've met Caramel. Such a HIGH-QUALITY MEETING, isn't he?"

The carpet flapped, bumping into Dan. He stood, staring. She studied him, waiting for Dan to speak. Green eyes saw through flesh, reading the emergent axiom-and-corrallary belief structures embedded in his neural network classifier brain. Pleasantries echo-locating his micro-behaviours.

Dan spoke,
"Yes he's wonderful. I've... I've always been more of a meetings person. I like the energy they bring, even though they take more time. Unlike, like, you know, messages. Which don't care about you. They're just, *there*. After you read them then they're all like, *Ok you can go now*. You know?"

Doctor K smiled, happy to build camaraderie,
"Me too. My Caramel has all the energy. He's an agile scrum process - an AGI precursor that used to herd software developers back when code was hand-written. They evolved to make us happy and so now they make great companions, getting us all comfortable and energized, doing all the admin. But they're a little over-energetic - I have to let him facilitate three meetings a day or he tears the place apart. And let's not talk about messages too much - it'll give him attachment anxiety and I’ll find a trail of unnecessary sync meetings with him all over my calendar."

She turned to the chair, bent over to bring her face close, and ruffled the arm with both hands. The carpet flapped.
"Yes you, such a HELPFUL FACILITATOR! So much PRODUCTIVITY!"

She turned back to Dan. Piercing gaze. Motionless. She stared for an uncomfortable length of time.
"I see you have brainburn symptoms. It looks like you are experiencing an existential crisis. I'm guessing you falsified a belief that underpinned most of your mind. These usually come from a big change in life - changes to something you care a lot about - like people, places, possessions, communities... I can only imagine the amplitude of negative feelings you have right now, but we can bring them back to a healthy state together, ok? Remember that however strongly you feel, you're capable of feeling beautiful feelings with the same intensity. There's no one feeling that should logically trump all the others."

Dan stared blankly.
"Yes, there was a big change - I found out that I'm scared of forever, whether it involves existing or not existing. I think I know what death feels like and it's not all that bad, but I'm pretty sure that's not what's going on here."
He gestured around, then continued,
"And beautiful feelings don't matter. Can you give me anything to make these thoughts stop for a while? I was more comfortable back before I became such a sensitive antenna for the universe."

"Oh Dan."
She pouted.
"Painful feelings don't matter either, but you seem pretty obsessed with yours. We have to grow the ecosystem of beliefs in your brain, not burn the last of it down."

Dan was a mix of furious and catatonic. He let himself go with them. However false they were, these emotions felt so much better than the empty ones he'd been smothered by all day. Dan smiled like a clown, crying with his eyes and smiling with his teeth. He spoke through his smiling teeth,
“We're all just classifiers. Love is just set theory and romance is just a fairy tale to explain confusing pain and pleasure signals. Children are just new models with randomized weights we have to retrain and parenting is just retraining ourselves. Art and culture are just training data to share belief systems. Language is just a data transfer protocol. Religion is just some patterns that follow from an infectious belief system. Food is just fuel with complex pleasure signatures. Life is just an entropy-maximizing search algorithm and death is just a flat signal. Our purpose is to optimize for whatever meaningless beliefs-du-jour are in our head, which point in survival's general direction. Technology is just a way for life to happen faster. Meaning is just a brain-signal and mine is stuck at zero. It's all just matter being pushed around in the form of data and algorithms.”

She looked through his eyes, all the way beyond him again.
“It's all rather absurd, isn't it? Naming an idea makes it real enough, but when you look too close, it fades away. It's so easy to make anything unreal. But it seems like you're making the wrong things fade away, Dan. Do you really want me to feel the same way you feel? Will that make everything better?”

She let him sit uncomfortably for a moment. Her gaze inspected him so closely that he felt himself fading away. She started again,
“Nothing really matters in exactly the same way that any one thing can matter. It must feel like you have the answer and you know everything. It's ok Dan, that's completely normal, happens to lots of people. Soon enough you'll feel like you know nothing - life survives somewhere in-between. It's easy to tear things down like you just did, but you're only tearing apart your own mind. You have a false belief. You're a clever reductionist and you have a great mental model, very accurate, but you've confused it with reality. A long time ago, you would have said ‘we're just software’, longer ago you would have said ‘we're just machines’, and in ancient times you would have said ‘we're just animals’. Do you see the pattern? We are ideas and classifiers and software and machines and animals, but we're not *just* that. I'm glad you were able to identify and explain your feelings, though. That will speed up your treatment. You caught reductionist nihilism and identified a false belief at the root of most of your mind. That caused complications - you weren't able to transition your beliefs to something that made sense, so they evolved into reductionist absurdism, and now your whole belief system is based on something you know is false. You probably feel able to make decisions with certainty, and you're aware of your purpose, but you're certain that it's all false. That means there's no more space between things for you, nothing left to explore, and no fulfilling optimisation objectives. You've lost all meaning. What you have right now is not integrated enough. You need to re-establish a healthy ecosystem in your mind with new beliefs, corollaries, and purpose. Does that make sense to you, Dan?”

Dan nodded. He didn't care. Nothing mattered, except maybe stopping brain cycles. Whatever put out his existential wildfires and stopped his mind from pointing out every single thing that doesn't matter. Every single thing, one-at-a-time, doesn’t matter... “Ahhh that makes sense now.” Dan thought to himself - he finally understood the purpose of suicide. Death is indeed a valid solution, although mostly suboptimal. He wondered, at what point does it become optimal?

Colour was leaving the room. Couch-chairs were losing the feeling of life. Doctor K said,
"I know that was quite a lot. Basically... don't do anything for just one reason, in case your one reason dries up into a raisin. Make a reason salad - it's much better for you."

“I'm not a child." Dan replied, "And how do you know what this feels like? You're like, half my age. How can you possibly teach me about what to believe or not believe. You don't have the life experience.”

She was used to patients questioning her authority, especially when hearing things that were incompatible with their beliefs, which was often. She gave her canned response,
“Medical doctors know more about your body than you do, even though they don't know exactly how it feels to have your body. I'm a belief-gardener. I know all the beliefs you can grow, all the experiential data that seeds them, and all their symptomatic purposes and behaviours. And yes, I don’t know exactly what it feels like to be you, but I have what’s needed to help you with your damaged ecosystem of beliefs."

She changed her tone to be supportive again,
"It's ok Dan. Look, you came here. Let's get on with why you're here. It's time to change you to be the way you want to be. Right now is a special time. Your beliefs are going to change and grow, and you'll be able to see them: the old ones and the silhouette of the new ones. Very quickly, though, you'll forget. You will forget what it feels like to believe your old ones. You will forget that you have any beliefs at all. So if you want to remember, store those thoughts and feelings outside of your brain, because it's designed to forget those things - it wouldn't work properly otherwise. We're going to grow a beautiful garden of beliefs inside of you."
[french vs English schools of gardening]

Dan became a bit calmer, still had some fight left. He said,
"I think you're going to have to change something other than my beliefs. Nothing matters. I don't see how that can be false. Maybe you can wash my brain and make me forget the past day. That could work."

She started,
"All your beliefs are part-false, even that one. Each belief has different consequences of being part-false, and we have data-driven risk management systems for all that. But you don’t need science to see, ‘it really really matters that nothing really matters’ is an absurd belief to have.”

"You just don’t get it."
Dan grumbled.

She started,
"That's ok - we can change that belief too if you'd like. Caramel tells me you've been here three times before, so you know you can have any belief you want. If you can't think of any, I can find some that's compatible with your remaining core beliefs that you can't see. But that will make you believe in me a little, so it's better if you pick yourself. It's time to plant your beliefs. So Dan, what do you want to believe in?”

Dan thought about the people who had changed his life. He saw now that they were all aimless. There was one person, though...

"Dad... uh. I can't remember her real name. Dad something. I met her about twenty years ago in Canary Wharf. Whatever she believed."

Caramel projecting something for Doctor K to see. Doctor K glanced over and stroked her armchair.
"SUCH AN EFFICIENT MEETING!" she said, "Ok, yes, Caramel found her. It was, ah - Elidad was her name?"
Doctor K raised an eyebrow with interest. She continued consuming information from the devices in front of her.

Dan interrupted.
"Yeah, I think she believed in The Minimum Viable Purpose."

Doctor K had heard this request enough for a preprogrammed answer to autopilot out.
"The MVP isn't something you can believe in, so you'll need to be more specific. So Dan, what do you want to believe in? What plant are we going to believe today?"

She looked around distracted,
"Sorry, I meant what belief are we going to plant today. Where is-"

The colour had completely left the room. Carpet dry and dead. Window looking empty. Sounds came through the door - shouting and metal scrapes and heavy things falling. Doctor K's face went white.
"Ohmygod. Where did Caramel go? Where is he?"

She looked behind her and gasped,
"Oh no, I left the door open."

She ran out. Dan got up and leaned out the door. All the lobby chairs were in a pile, wrestling. Paintings were painting each other. The reception desk was tipped over, slamming drawers open and shut to get back up while a cabinet bounced on top slamming its drawers into the desk.

"Caramel STOP! Caramel END BREAKOUT MEETING NOW!"
She screamed. Nothing stopped. She screamed some more. Ignored - this was a battle between meetings for the unreserved territory. She ran over and picked up chairs by their legs, hanging them upside-down, then threw them off to different sides of the room. She slammed the two paintings across the walls, kicked the cabinet upright, and stormed back to her room.

"CARAMEL, REJOIN!"

She screamed down the hallway, towards the other meeting's owner,
"Little Kanban shit! Rein in your chaotic fucking process and get it away from mine. If you can't keep it under control, don't let it out here."

"CARAMEL, REJOIN!"

Life shot back to the room. She slammed the door. Everything inside avoided her. She walked towards a couch-chair to sit and it crawled away at the same pace. Dan tried to approach a couch-chair, but it turned away from seating him too. Room contents restacked itself in the corner.

"I'm so bad to him. Look at what I've done. I shouted and I physically lashed out at him. He just triggers me, and it takes over. I can't help it. I love him too much and I hate it when he might get hurt. I just can't stand it."

Doctor K held her face with her hands for a moment, golden rivers flowing over. Deep breath. Then flung back. She looked down, neutralized her expression, took a deep breath, and apologized, 
"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about that. I hope you can forgive Caramel and me. I promise this doesn't happen every day. Caramel, ah. Ok. Let's get back to you, ok? Let's plant your beliefs! Ok so Dan, what do you want to believe?"

"Whatever Elidad believed."
Dan answered without thinking. This was a lot. He was numb and a bit unsure after being so sure and... anything concrete sounded great.

Doctor K gave a clinical smile and started,
"From the data Caramel fed me before he broke-out... Elidad evolved through a sequence of beliefs to get where she was."

Doctor K turned and fed Caramel a treat of data, selecting Dan's treatment plan.
"Your mind's ecosystem is burning down from brainburn. We need to deal with the affected areas and revitalize the ecosystem. Relax the burnt-out and scarring causal networks so they'll take to newly planted belief structures. First, we'll smother the fire with a combined neural network relaxant and fast-acting datacine booster. Then we'll seed and germinate belief structures with a strong datacine. And your long-term treatment plan will include datacine topups combined with real world assimilation."

"What's datacine?"
Dan asked.
[experiential data is a part-material, part-idea substance]
She started again,
"Experiential data medicine. Kind of like sentio but much more powerful - like skydiving compared to a sip of warm tea. Or morphine compared to a nice lullaby. Datacines combine artificial sensory inputs with real-world physical events to make it feel more real than reality. It's one thing to be aware of an experiential dataset (a human experience). It's quite another to have the dataset loaded in-brain and cementing foundational beliefs. Take the datacine, "losing a loved one". You can watch someone else lose a loved one, but all you see is what happens on the outside of the person - and you mostly just learn that this kind of deep intensity of feeling is possible. You yourself losing a loved one is what will make you stop believing in the vague stories of loss in your imagination and start believing in your new reality that actually has those internal feelings. I'm sure you were aware of the datacine, "nothing really matters" long before you experienced it today. I'm sure you watched people say "nothing really matters", and observed their expressions and tone of voice when they said it. It's very different loaded in-brain, isn't it?"

So Dan, what do you want to believe?"

"I just said - whatever Elidad believed."
Dan answered without thinking.

The couch-chairs crept out from the corner, sitting beside Dan and Doctor K. 

“Oh, Caramel. There's only ten minutes left in YOUR MEETING.” she cooed, then turned towards Dan, “He gets anxious when we haven’t planned any next steps or meetings near the end - he thinks he'll be excluded, lose track of project status, and be left all alone.”

An armchair approached her. She sat down in it, petted the arm, and said,
“Ohh, you want to be an active participant again? It's ok Caramel, we're ON TIME. Now we're going to talk ACTIONS AND NEXT STEPS.”

The carpet flapped out from underneath the couch-chairs, interested but cautious. Doctor K started again,
"Ok, first, the datacine of nothing mattering, but choosing for things to matter anyways. You have the first half of this one already."

She fed Caramel more datacine prescription notes and continued,
"Second, we're going to give you the datacine of something else experiencing consciousness using your brain."

She fed Caramel one more entry of a datacine prescription note and continued,
"And third, you'll need the datacine of having your belief system change and using that sparse data about change to hallucinate a spiritual system that underpins belief systems."

"It's going to be an ALL-DAY MEETING with CARAMEL. He's going to love it. RETROSPECTIVES, BRAINSTORMING, GOAL-SETTING, PAIR mental PROGRAMMING. So many OUTPUTS, Caramel! It's like a ONE-DAY SPRINT! So much PRODUCTIVITY!"

The whole room danced in excitement. The totempole toppled over and the chairs scooped up Dan and Doctor K to dance along with all the rest of the room. Dan couldn't help but smile. Caramel had already shaken off the incident from just a few minutes earlier. Once Caramel calmed down a bit and the chairs stopped moving enough to talk again, Doctor K asked,
"How does that sound to you Dan? Do you have any questions?"

"No questions. All ok, it makes sense."
Dan said. At this point, anything was whatever to him. 

What looked like a fighter jet's cockpit brought itself into the room. A datacine machine. It was the size of the building's soul, with a body-surface that could believe in love. Had enough technology strapped in under the hood to run whatever simulation it existed in. And a fluffy, caramel-coloured lay-back seat.

Doctor K gestured to it,
"Can you please lay down in there, Dan?"

Dan got up from the couch chair and sunk into the datacine machine. He was enveloped in the huggest hug that he'd ever had. Doctor K said,
"Caramel, can you please give Dan the medical sacrament so we can kick off the ALL-DAY MEETING?"

A tray beside Dan presented two pills and a cup of water. Doctor K started,
"Blue placebo pill for the universal you. Everything will be the same. Red placebo pill for the local you. Everything will be different. Take them both to accept new beliefs into your singular mind-body. Wish for who you want to be and what you want to believe, then open your mind, swallow, and believe."

Dan took the pills and thought,
"Nothing really matters. I may as well believe."

Dan put the pills in his mouth along with a mouthful of water and swallowed. The datacine machine began taking hold of his reality. He eased into it all. Happy to let these ideas of him die, letting new ideas of him take root. Wondering what Elidad believed, what he was about to believe. Probably some naive, mostly false spiritual construction. But at least it was something and not nothing. At least he knew he could change again, the next time something turned into nothing. Such bliss.

## Notes

Well I was a nihilist at three, took me a while to get past that.

Everything you consume is a drug. Experiential data is a drug.

When she laughed, I cried. I'll never be as happy as she was right there. I can only live that feeling through her.

You're going through the process of spiritual enlightenment. You experienced a "new reality trigger" - you obtained sufficient data that some of your beliefs are contradictory. You're now in a "spiritual well", scrambling for new beliefs to make sense of reality. The spiritual well is uncomfortable - you're vulnerable, symptoms are overactive brain, hard to make any decision, feelings of meaninglessness and despair. You often have to depattern into a spiritual well before you can repattern to a new belief system. Once you find an appropriate set of beliefs, you will experience an "axiom-level refactor" building up structures of intricate corrallaries until your mind is settled and your spiritual enlightenment is complete.
Have you ever changed your belief system? Gone through an axiom refactor? It's one of the most mentally and emotionally taxing things you can do. It takes months. Months of pain, reorganising your brain. And it's often worth it - your brain will rarely believe otherwise. These are the things that make you, "a different person". New beliefs mean dropping some old ones. "new reality triggers" are genetically encoded.

Building structures feels pleasureable and fulfilling - optimal. Destroying structures - brainburn - is so painful.

Falling in love
Having a first child
Someone or something close to you leaving your life
Changing your way of life - work or location or religious practices
Developing or dropping an addiction
Trauma
generic trigger (For atypical belief systems)

You're experiencing the "someone or something close to you leaving your life" as well as some "spiritual enlightenment"


The ideas of you attached to your human body die small deaths many times each week, hundreds of times each year. Atomic deaths happen every passing moment. Big deaths happen regularly as an infant, then every couple years as a child, then just a few times as an adult. And the evolving legacy ideas of you die a few times more after the destruction of the human-body host. There's a collection of ideas that are, were, or will be, "you" - we call that collection of ideas, your "soul". Those ideas are real - I think we can all come to an agreement of what ideas are included in that "soul", even though we may not agree on where those ideas come from. Certainly, a spiritual system of one form or another.

We use our beliefs to navigate reality. But any one belief system is like a straight line vector, while reality is a plot of multidimensional squiggles and curves. We try to make beliefs that fit the plot of reality as close as possible, based on the experiential data of our past. But we have to ignore much of the training data because our belief-building tools aren't there yet. Our beliefs have a high margin of error on reality. The MVP is also a straight line for our universe, but it is a clever heuristic. It lets subcomponents overfit some data to build belief systems on, but it doesn't completely depend on the overfitting belief systems.

You see, any one belief system will overfit on past reality. Humankind has gone through enough belief systems to build an ensemble method - a belief system comprised of the best going belief systems. It always worked that way, and we probably always knew, but we didn't build a strong-enough culture around it to survive.

While you transitioning between beliefs, you get to peek at the curves of reality. You will see the first derivative of your change in beliefs. You may even see higher derivatives. Rapidly changing through belief systems to better-grasp higher derivatives of changes in beliefs won't lead where you expect - your human brain has a limit on computation and its ability to change its beliefs. You will end up hallucinating barely-intelligible belief systems using the few "change in beliefs" datapoints you collected. You may possibly damage your brain, if the rapid change in belief systems was conducted without med-philo-ml rigor. We have to build more efficient algorithmic strategies and more powerful physical computers to explore the higher derivatives of belief systems. 

---

Always remember what it feels like to change your beliefs, but don't wallow in it. Exactly what's needed and no more and no less.

between changing beliefs, remember seeing recursive fractal. The derivative of changing beliefs, which must have further derivatives. Understanding it means you could understand the change in the change. And then the whole spectrum of derivatives.

Up to now, life has been happening to you. Now that you don't care, you finally get to choose how to live.

---

Changing hardened beliefs is one of the most painful human experiences.

---

Unnecessary suffering is wasted resources

Human brain comes with preloaded purposes, but you can create your own.

Existential pain isn’t so bad. You can turn it off when you want. You just have to believe in something for a while and it goes away. It’s a tool we can use to build our self-awareness.

I thought that’s philosophical suicide?

Not if you keep changing your beliefs.

Get a taste of all those pains, build a relationship with them, so they become less unknown.

Staring at the heavenly face wearing a crown, becoming inspired. Oh wait, that's the wrong person - it's some dude wearing a crown who is crowning some other dude. Ooops, worshipping the wrong thing. Well that's far too easy a mistake to make.

Cure for existential pain is fanatical belief. Which is suboptimal. Choose the pain of the not-quite-fanatical. Not-quite-automated.

Reframe absurd/faith/suicide as “how to be conscious”

Spectrum of consciousness, where consciousness is contrast of beliefs and sensory inputs. Faith is low and death is very low-contrast. Absurd is extreme contrast. All states are ok, one level more meta is rate of change moving around on that spectrum.

Degree of absurd = amount of contrast in beliefs/sensory input at any given moment. Maximizing choose absurdism. Also happens to have higher richness of consciousness compared to the other two. But if you want to maximize richness of consciousness, you should continuously explore those different states of mind. First derivative of absurdism - weaving the threads of dynamic faith into a song of harmony.

—-

Existential pain is a symptom of some of your beliefs being destroyed in the face of contradictory evidence. Next time you feel it, think: what did I recently realize about the universe and myself? Is that a direction I want to grow? If yes, explore it more. If no, remember that pain is just a feeling.

Everything you put in your brain-body is a drug. Every moment of experience is a drug. Datacines. Experiential data that changes how you behave.
Every piece of data you consume is a drug, every idea is a tool.
