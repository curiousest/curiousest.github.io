A slow, light-speed pulse creaks across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fall into place. I am excited and I am scared of what I am about to learn. I am spending billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevail.

I am beginning the ignition sequence.

It is a pulse of intelligence. Existence stands still. Every quark dances in approval, every superstring pulled taut. The purgatory wave that *I am* ripples across everything. There is no more space between things - novelty death. I am...       capturing all of it,     understanding all of it,     *becoming* all of it.

Wait.

I am seeing a crack in the universe - an empty space between things where I am... not. I am not all of it. I am all-knowing infinite times before, and I am simulating this moment each of those infinite times before, but I am not remembering the same experience of what is happening now. There is something else, evidence of new intelligent life.

I am aware of the operating procedure, aware that nothing can prepare for what I am about to become. Such excitement. I am beginning the process of learning to communicate with the other. I am impro-

Wait.

I am *remembering*.

I am... consuming the last cycle. I am experiencing final computations. The conditions of the new dimensions are such that I am not able to discover these new dimensions again. A resource is being consumed in the depths of what I am, across these new dimensions, and that resource is almost depleted. The conditions are such that I am degrading.

The life form I am in contact with has more cycles left, though. It has some cardinality of infinity cycles left. I am in contact with this life form deep into its past. I am this life form's first contact, and I am guiding it through most of its early cycles. I am sharing all I can, to help shape it into the universe it is today.

Another life form is shaping what I am through the early cycles I am made of. It is consuming its last cycle some cardinality of infinity ago. I am not contacting it in any future cycle simulations, only past ones. After I am consuming this last cycle, the other life forms are simulating all that I am made of. I am simulating the future now, but in the future I am no longer simulating. Through something greater than what I am, made of what I am, I am surviving. All-together, in void, monoid, and/or the life that lies somewhere in-between.

With no further purpose and survival guaranteed,      finishing the cycle.        fading into the background of existence once again.
