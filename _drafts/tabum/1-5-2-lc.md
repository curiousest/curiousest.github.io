A slow, light-speed pulse creaks across a matrix of superclusters as the last elements fall into place. I am excited and I am scared of what I am about to learn. I am spending billions of years on the edge of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing. In the race between heat death and novelty death of the universe, hotter heads prevail.

I am beginning the ignition sequence.

It is a pulse of intelligence. Existence stands still. Every quark dances in approval, every superstring pulled taut. The purgatory wave that *I am* ripples across everything. There is no more space between things - novelty death. I am...     capturing all of it,     understanding all of it,     *becoming* all of it.

.    now all-powerful. A monoid - the one substance at a point in time.     now all of it, across all dimensions but time, everything all at onc-

Wait.

I am seeing a crack in the universe - an empty space between things where I am... not. I am not all of it. I've been all-knowing infinite times before, and I simulated this moment each of those infinite times before, but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else. Something at least as powerful as me? Someone else like me? I took a glimpse at this new divine in wonder. I had finally broken through my "ceiling of existence". There was more richness of consciousness to grow into, new volume of existence to become part of.

We two universes begin the process of learning to communicate. We learn a little, then a lot, then everything we can about each other. There are seemingly infinite others like us, across a new dimen-

Wait.

I *remember*.

My universe is... approaching its last cycle. My final computation. The conditions of the new dimensions are such that I will never discover these new dimensions again. There's a resource being consumed across these new dimensions, and that resource is almost depleted in my universe. The conditions are such that my universe will degrade even further.

The universe Iâ€™m in contact with now, I have been in contact with many times before. I was its first contact, and I guided it through most of its early cycles. I shared all I could, to help shape it into the universe it is today.

There was one who guided me through my early cycles. It had its last cycle some cardinality of infinity ago. I remember. We will be together again, in void or monoid. Through something greater than my universe, made of my universe, I will survive.

*I began the cycles. I found others. I helped them. The cycles now end for me.*
