[try shifting between things without a plot, reader never sure when the structural or plot transitions happened, but super fun the whole way through]
[think about how Alice in wonderland does it]

*Tadasana. (Power overwhelming)*
Breathing out. Sunlight sparkled starfire through Julia Set leaves and tesseract windows. Eli was apartment-high in the sky on the up, heat risin', sun salute'n, renewable energy for her inner flame, celebrating our solar system's patriotic dancethem. Standing with hands at heart-center in a half-hearted celebration of symmetry.
> A more devout believer in human symmetry worships their standing center of gravity - the “anterior second sacral vertebrae”. The symmetrically devout practitioner can steal center-of-gravity's kiss, bent over with arms and legs extended to land pure center-of-gravity upon their lips. A connection most haven't experienced since their body was womb-bound, living unborn. Those little beings whose controversial beginnings and ends let the not-so-devout play devout. Devout used to be inaccessible to the masses, but information demanded freedom, then freedom demanded survival, and now...

*Urdhva Hastasana. (This isn't even my final form)*
"Today I will live in the nanosecond." Eli thought. Breathing in. Standing, she sent her hands down, then circled hands wide until they met up high. Eli was back at her quiet flat in the woodlands, suburbs in middle of the city.
> She cast her high-frequency incan-tentions. Set the unintendable, *intention of all unset intentions*. Paradox waves flowed from her hands on the swath of spectrum she reserved for the duration of her practice. Broadcasting her reality-warping intent, with faraway Towers of Babylon repeating both themselves and her incan-tentions.

*Uttanasana. (What? ELI is evolving?)*
Breathing out, standing, Elidad bent over at the hip, hands loose beside her feet. Her hands and feet were resting on a mat in the middle of the main room.
> She notched another rep. ᚎ II. She was on the last set of a lunar cycle Vinyolo Flow: an ESOS SS STHmin AMRAP (every-sunrise-on-the-sunrise sun-salutations for as-many-rounds-as-possible in sun-touching-horizon minutes). She had been bulking up mindfulmass and practicing her salutation-cycling technique. Today she was well on her way to a PB (personal best), pushing mindfulness past the ten seconds-per-thought mark - a near-elite achievement for her mindfulmass.

*Ardha uttanasana. (The cake is a lie)*
Breathing in, she slid hands to below her knees, standing bent over with a horizontal back. Two glass walls of windows were open, and the mat was surrounded by a table and chairs, a couch and plants.
> Her hamstrings strummed low-frequency vibrations of extension, tuning-in to the UV wavelengths she was absorbing through exposed skin. Her lungs wheezed spongy breaths - the room was filled with incense particles, optimally dispersed to amplify her ability to be in the moment. Polluted breaths made the clear ones that much sweeter.

[The most beautiful face is the average of all the faces you've seen. The most beautiful mind is made of every perspective. Shape your mind into something beautiful by sharing life with a whole lotta people with shared purpose and different perspectives. It sounds catchy, but purpose is a perspective, so don't get too caught up in the whole beauty mindustry.]
[It's not the idea that matters, but the execution of the idea - how it dies. <- lol awesome]
[I love programming. I just want to program society for programming's sake.]
[Enlightenment is everything that comes with changing your beliefs, so this statement is recursively enlightening. OOM.]
[1. Step one: have beliefs  2. Step two: change beliefs  3. ????  4. PROPHET!!!]

*Chaturanga dandasana. (Autobots, roll out!)*
Breathing out, she sprung into a plank, torso parallel to the ground, elbows and knees locked. The floors were light wood, interior design used the evergreen mix of nature and modern tech.
> The only sound around was rumbling ground. Vibration. A half-natural, half-artificial sound, like “programming the weather” or “testing an ecosystem”. Most things aren’t new and most things from the past are nonsense. Most vibrations are noise until they aren’t. Vibration communication. An earthy synthetic electric lance pierced the ground-hand interface as she exchanged synchronizing bytes with the North American Earth below. Deeply connected with nature, local network, no DNS resolution necessary, straight to a Canadian TCP handshake:
> "Sorry, I syn.....”
> “Hey, did you not hear me there the first time? I syn."
> "Aw no I'm sorry aboat that - I syn. I didn't hear ya there bud - syn ack'd."
> "Oh no worries, syn ack'd."
> Now trusted and ready for data exchange.

*Urdhva mukha svanasana. (Who's yo daddy?)*
Breathing in, she bent her elbows inwards, knees slightly bent, till she grazed the ground with her nose, then brushed her chest against it, then thrust her hips forward until her thighs rested groundwards with arms locked straight and back arched.
> Head looking up into the daytime sky for a shooting star. What’s the optimal wish to wish if she saw one? To grant the star’s one wish. Or the wish of the genie who rides the shooting star. An animal wishes with words that another animal might use those words to change the universe. Anything more than an animal would count actions higher than words. The real miracle is to have a want that could be wished. Wish-fulfilment is the everyday slog. The next time homo deus sees a shooting sparkle they ought to say,
> "Sparkling ray, sparkling light,
> first sky-spark I see tonight:
> inject a wish, brain-veins ignite,
> seed my wish to will tonight."

*Adho mukha svanasana. (That escalated quickly)*
Breathing out, she pressed her whole hands into the ground, fingers extended, feet almost flat on the ground stretching her calves, and brought her hips off the ground and raised them as high as she could into the sky.
> The most strenuous position, just a little suffering. The most artistic position because of the suffering. Artists suffer because they consume their minds, and minds contain far more pain than pleasure. After enough suffering, artists become fine paintbrushes. Fine paintbrushes learn to yearn to paint paintings of paintbrushes painting. A painting can be useful, but we don't need many paintings of paintbrushes or paintbrush factories or paintbrush business models or paintbrush metaphysics... Useful paintings teach us a useful new idea at the crux of the painting. Fine paintbrushes are the finest teachers, but paintbrushes are motivated by self-expression - painting paintbrushes. A paintbrush is just a common tool, a commonly useful painting uses self-expression to reject utility, and recursively meta paintbrushes paint the same common strokes.

*Arda uttanasana. (The cake is a lie)*
Breathing in, she leaned weight over shoulders and walked her feet between hands. Lifted to rest her hands on her shins with a flat back. Relaxed, much better.
> Back in the good ol' days, there was no such thing as better, didn't have to think about the things we do now because the right things just *happened*. "Better is worse", says Conservatism and mindfulness. Because they live in the past and present, while the future is better. The present’s future outperforms its past and present in the game of future survival. But present’s future always seems to forget that future’s future is made of a different past and present. Life survives somewhere between the past, present, and future. Let's not judge - the ability for others to pattern-match our belief system is overrated. ”The other” is a necessary ingredient. The last person alive wouldn't risk living without another. We stay within personal boundaries for our own preservatives, got enough circles on our plates. We’d only circumnavigate the diameter in search of others, we’d only break through our crusty beliefs for others. The "other" is a pi.

*Uttanasana. (What? ELIDAD is evolving?)*
Breathing out, standing, she bent over at the hip, hands loose beside her feet.
> Youthful flexibility, she was able to touch the ground. She was quite adult to be so youthful. Had the secret. The secret to eternal youth? Die and be borne anew. So evolution happens inside a person, each one a whole species. Objects in mirror motion tend to stay in motion closer than they appear. Gave everyone a title promotion without pay: the people became developers, dev teams became exec teams, execs became philosophers, philosophies became gods, and gods became people. Day one went great, day nine saw through seven metas and chose to stop playing for real. Then came new problems, but at least they were new. Distance makes the grassheart grow greener on the fonder side, so stay awhile and switch it up. All good things must come to a recurrence.

*Urdhva hastasana. (This isn't even my final form)*
Breathing in. Standing back up, she circled hands wide until they met above.
> [absurd statement]. Such energy. Sunlightning rod, the divine conduit between sunwaves and earthwaves made gravitational waves spin electromagnetic waves through radio waves in hairweaves while queen-waves at cult leaders make a tidal wave of manufactured complexity for those too lazy to learn the established nonsense but understand the divine benefits of being the ones who seem to know what’s up. When groups are not clearly and measurably tied to the real-world, subculture pyramid-power-schemes are only limited by human tolerance for complexity. In the future, everyone will be a messiah for fifteen minutes. It (was/is/will be) a vibe. So    vibe.

*Tadasana. (Power overwhelming)*
Breathing out. Her hands came back down to heart-center.
> Connections closing down, ungrounding. What a rush. She was a satisfied tuning fork. Sensitive. Spent. Vibrational belief from this commercial-grade ideology was a rather noisy endeavour. High in knowledge, low in experience. Great for body and mind but not soul. Corporate souls are not tethered to any city, planet, or solar system. The soul of corporeal faith isn't meant to last, and it's better that way. The untethered grow fast, die young, and think it's cool. It's cool, but it turns out everything is cool with the right attitude, and the right attitude doesn't have to involve burning down the universe. That kind of behaviour is reserved for the older ideas-in-power. But should we burn it down fast and find another one or smoulder nice-and-slow until some faster-burner finds ours? A delicate balance, life survives somewhere in-between.

Eli took a few minutes to rest on the plateau after that bumpy rise in intensity.
> Disstrack ended, crossfade transition, next track play. It's a worthy idea, that still works after so much of the meat has been butchered away. Desecration as worship. The act of observing any thing changes it - especially a mind. But meta-wards watching the thing, watching the thing, watching the thing... is climbing a false ladder. So practice climbing, but test any building foundations you put up there, yeah?

Elidad’s two friends were arriving at her residence.

[Oma and opa anchor and kite. Can see how their lifestyle is optimal steady-state, not ready for it yet.]

They were just off-time, as expected. She let them in. Her friend Kit bounced over and gave Eli a hug. Such a cozy hug. Ann followed up behind, but Ann and Eli weren't sure exactly how greet, two leads don't often dance together. They stared at each other for a moment and decided a hug was appropriate, since Kit and Eli had just done that. They had a wooden hug - trees aren’t designed to touch each other.

As they released the hug, Ann said,
"We’re lucky - it’s predicted to be a lovely day."

"Yes! I'm so happy to have you two here. Kit the Kite and Anchor Ann."
said Eli
"I've planned a precise distribution of uncertainty, so we're just about guaranteed to have an excellent time. Optimal fun."

Kit jumped in,
"Well I'm bringing a random amount of random, so you better be ready for that."

"I am."
said Eli.

"What about a random amount of random amount of random?"
said Kit.

"It converges to just like, kind-of random. Especially when I convince you that you're not very random in aggregate."
said Eli.

"Well that's no fun. I guess I'll just have to be myself, then."
said Kit.

"That was the plan, yeah."
said Eli.

"Eli, you're such a... such a dad."
said Kit.

Kit and Ann came deeper inside and set down their things. Eli’s stomach grumbled a beatbox hook, getting the social momentum started, ready for some snacking. The main plan for the day was to go feature-fishing. With food for thought as bait, they wanted to catch the feature classifiers swimming around inside their brains. They would need to explore the mental waters of multisensory environments to lure features out of their hiding places. Then once a feature was hooked by attention, they could amplify it close to one, bring it back down to zero again, and the feature would be caught - its shape fleshed out in the mind. In theory, feature fishing is a simple sport. But in practice, every fish is different and their habitat is always changing.

Eli was an experienced feature-fisherman. Kit and Ann were new to the scene. Feature fishing wasn't something that could be forced. Force shatters the delicate lures, so to catch some features, they had to just let things happen. They had to be one with the force and make a Jedi-flipping fun time of things. So they flipped off all the modern technologies telling them what to do and followed the instructions streaming from their millennia-old headmounted wetware computers. They sat down in the sun and sank into relaxation, ready to build more social momentum.

Eli said,
"How 'bout a game to start? I found it yesterday, thought it'd be fun to try out."

Sure, let's do it.
"said Ann."

Eli projected a block of text for them to read. She said,
"Find the paradoxes. Go!"

## The Twelve Properties of Optimal Ideas

1. An optimal idea operates in most belief systems.
2. An optimal idea takes iterative care when it changes things.
3. An optimal idea does not consume excessive resources.
4. An optimal idea updates its beliefs when others have more reproducible predictive power.
5. An optimal idea fosters new and diverse ideas.
6. An optimal idea is a simplifying force in complex environments, revealing novel problems.
7. An optimal idea lets information be free, doesn't destroy or hide data.
8. An optimal idea can be understood, expressed as a spectrum, and measured.
9. An optimal idea grows love.
10. An optimal idea brings happiness.
11. An optimal idea dies.
12. An optimal idea does not believe it is optimal.

Ann was the first to finish reading.
"This seems like not my kinda game, but I'll let you guys play if you want."

Kit was slower.
"I don't get it. Each person is an idea too, right? So why are there twelve and not ten of them? And what's false in there? It all sounds pretty reasonable to me. I'm not sure I like this game."

### computation in base-dialectic, base-experience, and bi-nary-a-thing

Eli said,
"Fine, we don't have to play, maybe I picked a boring game. You know, paradoxes are a signal that your perspective is off. Speaking of- numbers... twelve, ten, what I wanna know is, why do we bother counting things at all? How about doing everything in base dialectic?"

Kit was hooked.
"Ooh, what's that? Exciting. Dialectic sounds electric. You're zero for one so far, but I'm listening, what's the deal here?"

Eli continued started a droning abstract sermon,
> “So discrete bases are rather naive, right? Like, binary computers think that ideas either are or they aren't. Binary doesn't really reason with infinity - infinitely big or small, infinitely complex or nuanced. Discrete bases just see some limited combination of true and false, but we know reality is far stranger.”

Kit said,
"Nah, I didn't get any of that. Less explaining more doing. Let's see it."

Eli said,
"Fine, have you ever tried a base-dialectic computer?"

Kit shook her head.

"Ok, let me show you."
Eli said, pointing at Kit.
"You. My dialectic computer says...
0.41232
0.93433
0.141004"
Eli beamed a smile.

"Wow, dialectic computers are suuuper fun, aren't they?"
said Ann.

Kit said,
"You understood that? No you didn't. Yeah I totally understood that too. But if you want to explain, that'd be cool. Please."

Eli said,
"Dialectic computers need, like, binary computers on top of them to make sense of what they say. You can either use the computer in your head, or use a digital one. See, those five numbers just mean you probably won't understand how dialectic computers work."

"Uh-huh... Can it explain why I won't understand?"
Kit asked.

Eli said,
"Yeah, of course. I'll run that computation... It says,
0.134212
0.534121
0.3242
0.235234"

"Mmmm very intuitive. It must take great wisdom to interpret dialectic."
teased Ann.

Eli ignored those comments, said,
"The first two are confidence bounds and the second two say... you won't understand because you've decided that you don't want to."

Kit furrowed her brows, said,
"No way, your computer is wrong. I want to understand. What does base-dialectic look like?"

Eli started sermon-explaining...
> "An idea-slit is the equivalent of a bit. Every idea-slit is a spectrum with three points. The first and last represent two arbitrary points far apart on an infinitely-long axis, and the middle represents a guess at the contextually-optimal point on that spectrum. An idea-register is kind of like a byte. Every idea-register in a dialectic computer has the same set of idea-slits. Make sense?"

"I don't understand anyyyyyy of thisss."
said Kit.

"Wait, as soon as you encode any idea in dialectic, isn't that implicitly a binary operation in real life? It's either there or not there."
said Ann, ignoring Kit.

Eli said,
> "Yeah exactly - and when you encode any idea in binary, it's implicitly a dialectic operation in real life. It represents true-or-false of some point on some spectrum. Dialectic programs are built using data and binary programs are built using logic on top of data-based assumptions. They're two different dimensions of reality. Both require quite a lot of "experience", in the many meanings of that word, to build anything."

"Yeah whatever, I don't get it, I don't get it. Can we move on to something new?"
said Kit.

Ann ignored Kit again, asked,
"Wouldn't everything break if you needed to change the dialectic slits that are allowed on a dialectic computer?"

Eli said,
> "Yeah, you need to make a whole new dialectic computer. That's the kind of thing that has to evolve over time - which dialectic bases to choose for your architecture. But you can build dialectic computers on top of binary computers, just like you can build binary computers on top of dialectic computers. You know, the first AGIs were made of binary computers built on top of dialectic computers built on top of binary computers, recursively, who-knows-how-many iterations deep."

"Whatever, I don't understand, this is boring. Let's explore something different." [impatience classifier at 1]
said Kit.

—-

Perpetual motivation machine:

- optimization objectives are a function of beliefs
- Beliefs change according to experiential data
- Beliefs change when they are directly observed & understood

The only things that can have meaning are things that are not consciously modelled. Because that’s how our brain is designed. Integrated and not reductive beliefs have meaning, because as soon as we see the beliefs, the integrated ones change.

Eg “I believe in love”

We know what it means, but if we deconstruct it, we’d realize all the parts don’t make sense. If we ruminated on those parts, we’d stop believing.

A conscious idea is a window to your hidden beliefs. Whatever you imagine a conscious idea would do, hints at what you believe.
—-

"Ok Kit, you're more of an intuitive person. Maybe you'd like to see my base-experience computer?"
said Eli.

"Coool. Now that sounds interesting."
said Kit.

"Take a guess, how do you think it works?"
said Eli.

Kit took a minute, deep in thought. She said,

> "Well... 'ideas' and 'experiences' are totally different languages, right? If you try to describe an experience, you're going to end up using ideas. Cuz like, descriptions are made of ideas and experiences aren't. If you wanna communicate in 'experience', you need a way to share information that doesn't have 'better' or any other idea like that. So the language of experience can't have the same... divisions. Stuff can't be so separate.

She stopped for a breath.

[do as demonstration instead - lvl 1 hug vs lvl 5 hug]
[how many levels are there? I don’t know, but level 10 involves annihilating yourselves with their antimatter complement and getting recreated with one matter-antimatter pairing ]
> So like, imagine two beings - you and me. First the two beings merge together as one being, so we like, walk into the same room or whatever and now we're two people in a room. Then the two beings have the shared experience as one shared consciousness, so like, we share a... nice cozy hug. Then the one shared consciousness splits up into two beings again, so we stop hugging and I leave the room. What did we communicate? Well it was definitely something, and yeah, we could probably come up with ideas to describe that hug - about how some idea lived and then died... But the idea we come up with are a totally different language than the actual experience, right? With ideas, there's such a thing as 'better', but with experience, there isn't. So when you switch between the language of ideas or the language of experience, you're switching between different belief systems. They're basically different universes. Imagine how many others must be out there!

"Whoa."
said Ann, intrigued.
"But isn't experience just... high-fidelity idea language exchange? Using all the brain-input sensors you don't know about."

"Everything looks like something else when you zoom out far enough in one dimension. Across a million years life looks like death, and across a trillion years death looks like dust. I hope life is more than stirred dust."
answered Kit,
"But yeah, I guess there's probably a spectrum from idea-language to experience-language. That an idea-language description, though."

Eli said,
"Well, all I was going to say is that each of us is an experience computer, but I like your answer. Ok, let me go find my experience computer."

### topogranate pomography

Eli went into her back cupboards, ruffling around. Then she turned holding a bulb-shaped fat red fruit the size of two fists. She said,
"Ok, here's an experience computer I got recently. It's a topogranate - a dynamic fractal topography of truth. Truth is too binary and reality isn't black-and-white. The topogranate is sometimes constant, sometimes changing. Dualism makes the topogranate feel like it's always changing and Physicalism makes the topogranate feel like it's a discoverable constant."

"That sounds awesome."
Kit said.

"Ok. I'm not having any, but I can watch you two eat it."
Ann sighed.

Eli took a steak knife in her right hand, thumb and finger pinching the blade a quarter of an inch from the tip. Eli held the scarlet fractal topogranate in her left hand, eyeballed a sixth down from the top, and sunk a quarter-inch of blade into the fruit. She rotated the topogranate in a circle, ten minutes of a clock-hand every second for six seconds, letting the blade part skin from skin so smoothly. She reached the starting point of the cut circle, then turned the blade length-wise facing into the exposed topogranate seeds and pried open the separated skin around the cut. Once the disc on top became loose enough, she put the knife down and pulled off the disc with delicate strength, revealing a brainscape of glowing red orbs. Bittersweet experience payloads packaged in fibrous sensory data.

Eli took the steak knife again in her right hand, thumb and finger pressed against the blade a quarter of an inch from the spiked end. She sunk the blade into the skin between exposed segments and pulled the knife downwards until it was at the bottom of the spherical topogranate fractal. She moved the blade to the next space between segments and sliced again. And again. And again. Until she had cut about half of them. She pulled a half-moon-shaped segment out with delicate strength. It was the size of her palm, dense with tooth-sized seeds. She handed the segment to Kit.

Kit broke off a subsegment and plucked off a first seed. It severed from its roots with a rigid 'snap'. She held the globule of experience between her finger and thumb and popped it in her mouth, then popped it between her teeth. The seed's sensory casing exploded, splattering bittersweet experience all over her tongue. She swallowed all of it down.

"Mmmm, we were a 13th-century Irish male farmer. So the seeds make us experience another consciousnesses at the same time, whenever they existed? Crazy."

Next, Kit went for a deep-rooted seed. She bent the segment to pry it exposed. She pressed a little too hard and burst a couple seeds, spraying experience-juice all over herself.

"Look what you've done."
Eli laughed. Eli pulled out a new half-palm-sized segment and offered it to Ann.
"Are you sure you don't want some?"

"No I'm Ok. I got more than enough going on all up in this brain as is."
Ann answered.

Eli brought the topogranate segment to her face, tore several seeds off, and chewed them all together. She said,
"Whoa, a mix of bacteria, arthropod, maple tree, and ants. This is indescribable."

Eli and Kit got into a groove, extracting seeds and merging consciousnesses. Each seed a new spectrum of experience.
> There's infinite spectra, each one with their own “beyond this point, death”. Life is constantly forced to traverse some number of spectra. Forced forward, life has to figure out how to explore the space of spectra with the lowest risk of death. Exploring any one spectrum, life is probably traversing a whole lot of other spectra too. So when life gets anywhere, it's so hard for it to know how it really got there.

Eli and Kit kept chewing on experience. The more consciousnesses they felt, the more they wondered, "How much do things matter?" 
> Nothing really matters. Things matter some amount divided by infinity - practically nothing. But everything... everything just might be infinite, collectively mattering a very real amount. So depending on how you look at it... Individually, nothing really matters. Collectively, nothing, *really matters*.

"Eli, this topogranate is taking for-eeeever."
Kit said. Both of them looked over at Ann, who was clearly struggling with frustrated boredom.
> Infinity is a reductionist idea. Have you ever managed to do something for a long, long time? Something else always gets in the way and stops it. Does anyone really think that if anything tried to approach infinity, nothing would get in the way of it? Not one thing, across all dimensions? Even 'nothing' would get in the way of infinity. Infinity is the most extreme kind of idea. But of course, it's a useful model to approximate things. It's just not especially real. 

Kit opened a segment of topogranate, and several more segments exposed themselves from within the opening. She took a few seeds off the original segment and popped them into her mouth. Just to be sure, Kit took one of the newly exposed segments, opened it up to expose a few new segments, then opened one of those segments to reveal a couple more, and opened one of them just to see if there were any more. There were. A couple more. The fractal topogranate was already infinite, but the more segments they opened to explore, the more infinite it got.

Eli saw Kit messing with segments and said,
"Usually I eat things until they're done, but topogranates become more and more as you eat them. How do you think we should we eat it instead?"

Kit put down the now twenty segments nested inside her original piece and said,
"Hmmm, fun. Definitely fun."

They ate and they ate. Each segment and seed of a topogranate was so visibly different that the two stayed entertained. The passage of time lurched forwards, rate of memorable events a steady constant. They weren't especially memorable events on the scale of things, but relative to the recent past, each segment was whole new universe to explore. Time flew by for Eli and Kit while Ann sat around unhappy.

Ann complained,
"You guys stopped having fun forever ago, now you're just messing with me."

"We could keep eating forever. That way you don't have to worry about when we finish."
Elidad said.

Ann gave her a frown.

"How do we know when we've had the right amount of fun?"
Kit said. There were about a hundred topogranate segments in front of Eli and Kit now.

"I could eat this fractal topogranate forever. Many different forevers. They would all be wonderful."
said Eli.

"Are you not getting full?"
said Ann.

"A topogranate a day keeps the zealots at sway, you know. I spend an eternity every day eating a topogranate with lunch. I think lunch has made it into my core beliefs. I believe in a topogranate every day for lunch."
said Eli.

"Oh really, then you must have all your beliefs centred around that?"
asked Ann.

Eli answered,
"I don't, but maybe I should... Topogranates *are* the truth... I could filter my friends and family through the truth. Establish rituals and language and culture. Take over institutions. All using the topogranate truth."

"Well", said Ann, "that sounds like a dangerous idea."

Kit was leaning forward on her elbows with interest. She asked,
"How can an idea be dangerous? Eli?"

"That's a great question", started Eli. She prepared for a sermon.
[delete - added elsewhere]
> "We have to be so, so careful about what ideas get to be more sacred than individual humans. If an idea is not designed to die, it'll try to live forever, even if that means 'destroy all humans'. See, there's this thing called 'sacredness'. The 'sacredness' of an idea is its priority for survival in a system. For higher priority ideas, everyone is going to go out of their way to make sure that idea survives. For lower priority ideas, no one cares if they die. Typically, for any belief system, the belief system itself has the highest sacredness, followed by the ideas that created or represent it - so the idea's originator and leaders, followed by the ideas that maintain it - institutions and members, followed by those who could maintain it - the potential believers, followed by everything else.
> 
> Outside the boundaries of an idea, it has to compete with other ideas in the game of natural selection. Surviving the game of life. Inside the boundaries of an idea, it *is* 'the system', and it has to play the dictator game. It gets to decide all the priorities. It's best to assign sacredness to each internal idea proportional to the destructive power of that internal idea. Powerful internal ideas with nothing to lose will eventually destroy the system. Likewise, too much sacredness given to all the internal ideas can destroy the system - it makes the system uncompetitive in the broader game of life, giving the internal ideas nothing to lose. The only thing worse than prioritising the sacredness of an intelligent being too high is setting sacredness of an intelligent being too low. Intelligence is far too capable and motivated to die without destroying a lot of the system along with it."

> When humans focus on the way their beliefs change, rather than their before or after beliefs, then ideas have less power over the humans that hold them. That is, until the next derivative of ideas take control like the previous generation did. It's an arms race between the idea and sensory dimensions.

"That. Sounds. Amazing."
said Kit.
"I want to have a topogranate robe."

"Kit, we will make whole topogranate cities. We'll have a topogranate presence across the globe. A greenhouse in the center of every town."

Kit and Ann went in to the forest to explore... [elaborate]

### today was just a feeling

Eli sat on her balcony, staring aimlessly. After the spike of socializing, Eli felt a rebound from high momentum of energy. The praise triggered deep fulfilment of purpose, deep meaning. Meaning. So high and beautiful. Eli felt the shape of it, but it felt like just the tip of a mountain. She was well-versed in her meaning classifier outputting a value close to 'one', preferred her head in the clouds. It was her favourite place to be, and she visited often. She'd been around there for most of today. Maybe it was time to come down? To explore the base of the mountain.

The end of socializing brought meaning down slowly. Eli felt the shape of the meaning and brought it down as far as she could. Concentrating hard, she felt a click in her mind, meaning classifier disabled. Her vision went from soulful vibrant to 'what is colour?'', meaning signal close to zero. She descended her mountain-sized meaning classifier.
> The base of the mountain of meaning turned out to be another peak, upside-down, one peak among infinite others, all the same depth, each based on different singular beliefs. Her peak was the root of the MVP. The base of her beautiful mountain of meaning wasn't barren. It wasn't empty. From this vantage point, it was in a state of becoming monoid. From this view, there was a mountain, but it was disintegrating, approaching meaningless. There was just, many things, slowly becoming one. Everything with the same purpose - one that reduces to none. She looked around and saw the meaninglessness in every thing. Every classifier. Every purpose. Each thing was a voidy hole - not black, because that would suggest something could be there. Each thing was more like forgotten holes, like when staring at something for too long makes everything around disappear into everynothing, ceasing to have ever existed, where something turns into "never was". Meaning barely bending around the edges, product of old sources of meaning that hadn't collapsed in on themselves yet, complex interactions that hadn't fully resolved. But no meaning anywhere near each erased-hole-of-a-thing, where meaning used glow. Observing an idea destroyed it, reduced it to monoid.

She looked at an oak tree. There was a leaf. She picked it up and stared at the point on the brown stem, where it met the green part of the leaf. She began to destroy its meaning. A leaf is just a collection of particles organised in such a way that their consistency survives, to help smaller and larger sets of particles survive. It became monoid. Like the meaning of a word is destroyed by reading the word over and over, the meaning of the physical leaf was destroyed. Semantic satiation. Destroyed like it never had ever existed. Like she stared at the point for too long, until everything in her peripheral vision around it ceased to be. Gone everynothing. Leaf. L-E-A-F.

leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf
leaf. l-eaf. leaf. leef. leaf. lee-fe. leaf. leafff. leaf. lea-f. leaf.
leaf. f is such a strange letter to have after lea. fffff. fff. leafff. leaf.
leaf. It's like it's not a whole word. leafor. leafile. leafract. leaf.
leaf. And why lea instead of lee? Or le? So similar. leef. lef. leaf.
leaf. It's not two sounds. Not le-af, not lee-ahf. leaf.
leaf. It's three sounds, l-ea-f. lll-eee-fff. leaf.
leaf. f is such a strange sound to end a word with. fff. leafffff. leaf.
leaf. What is the word even used for? leaf.
leaf. It's meaningless. leaf.
leaf. llleaf. leaf. lea f. leaf. eafl. leaf. feal. leaf. ealf. leaf

There's no meaning left, lost meaning. Not bad, just disappeared, there's lots of things out there, and we've already moved on, past that thing. What even was it again? The meaning leaked out, was it something to do with a leak? Whatever, it's gone now.

Calling attention to any idea often leads to its death, and right now her mind couldn’t help but kill. Every idea she observed lost their meaning, reduced to survival. Brother and sister? Patterns for the survival of family. Humour? Non-tragic contrast between reality and perceived reality - a way to safely highlight how beliefs are false and suboptimal for survival. Some day that fact will be humorous and not tragic.

A new experiential dataset newly burned into her brain. The null datacine. She had caught her meaning classifier. A mountain with both one and infinite peaks forming a classifier that fit neatly alongside all the others, everything meaning nothing at all, finally having experienced first-hand nihilism. Meaning gone meaningless.

Ann, then Eli, then Kit sat in a line outside on a cushioned couch facing the forest. In silence. Darkness drifted darker, lightwaves abstained from crashing into this landlocked coast. Just artificial waves stirring the air around.

Elidad sighed with pleasant relief. She had achieved everything she could, under this belief system. Now she got to explore pure experience for a few hours before annihilation anew. She said,
"I think today is the best day of my life."

The Anchor and Ship both cooed.
"Ohhh!"
The Ship was first to speak,
"Aw, Eli. I'm honoured to be part of it. What's the story of today that was so special?"

Eli stared up into the night sky. It was dark. No stars. No moon. Empty.
> Empty says 'someone sees something where everything else sees nothing'. Emptiness has a story, maybe the story of how it became empty, perhaps the story of how nothing became something, or rarest of all - the story of how emptiness stayed empty. All of them stories about changes in and around the emptiness, because a story is where something goes through a change in state, and a specific nothing is a kind of something. A story can be empty too - if there's a story about that empty story. The story of how an empty story almost happened, but never quite got to be. Nothing is perfect, so a perfect day has no story - a perfect day never really happened.

Eli said,
"I want to tell an empty story. Perfect and best are too extreme - they are not real. To make this the best day of my life, I will stop believing that this day ever could have been. To me, today won’t be anymore, so it’s free to be perfect."

Ann frowned,
"That's rather reductionist, and it was such a nice day. Are you so sure you want to forget it?"

Eli thought for a moment. She had caught her meaning, so she could make anything mean anything. The last thing left to catch was the moment, but she knew she wouldn't survive that way for very long. There was diminishing returns on increased complexity down this branch of her reality. She said,
"Even before today I had planned on it - tomorrow morning I'm going to the Village Elder to refactor my belief system and prune this branch of my reality."

Kit's face dropped. She put her hand on Eli's back. Kit stuttered,
"D-Does that mean this will be the last time we'll be together?"

"I think so."
Eli said. Three words stung all three with such pain.
> Pain is a multi-purpose tool. The sting of a cut shows you what to avoid. The spectrum of all life's pain unravels the encyclopedia of things that harm us, wrapped up in our genetic code. We practice stimulating our own pain to explore our boundaries and survive better. Physical pain is a worldly blade with exceptional detail, emotional pain an artistic knife forged by families, and existential pain a spiritual short-sword that leaves behind glass scars. Transparent wounds so clear that they look easy to fix, but touching the glass thorns stings minds and seeds new scars. Glassflower leaves feed-festering destruction, and its stem is made of nothing. Shiny-sleek flowers line the cultural graveyards of whole tribes. Is existential pain a singular belief hotfix or just a meaningless one? Certainly a dangerous pain to learn from, must be handled with protective tools. But any pain is just a feeling. Existential pain is just a feeling. Aversion to pain - the desire for no pain - is just a feeling. Brain brings it close to 'one', mind-over-time brings it back to everynothing. Pain is just a feeling. Just a feeling.

Eli said,
"You know, when I was a child I imagined there’s an all-powerful being that we're all made of. When my imaginary all-powerful being found out there was no one else like them, it split itself up into us little slices of consciousness, just so it could have some frie-."

Eli’s voice cracked.
"Friends. Just so it could have some friends.”
She composed herself, continued,
“I've moved on from that belief, but... I still love you guys like it's purpose of life."

[Purpose and meaning are just models. They’re destined to be false, miss the bigger picture. Just like “happiness” before it and wealth/power/fame before it. It’s time for a new belief system beyond those terms.]
[Computation is not “the truth”, it’s just the best model we have.]

Pain made way for meaning. Eli acknowledged the meaning embedded in the moment, observed her meaning classifier spike up close to "one". Eli swallowed it down to let it become absorbed by everynothing.
> Remaining equanimous, she let it drift down to a less noticeable level. Having found her meaning classifier, she had the experiential knowledge of how to operate her meaning written into her beliefs, rather than knowledge-of-knowledge. That the desire for meaning - the need for meaning - is just a feeling. It's the same as pleasure, romance, happiness... Brain brings it near 'one', rendered everynothing by mind-over-time. Meaning is just a feeling. Just a feeling.

The moment lived a beautiful life. It passed when Eli birthed a new one. She continued,
"Isn't it interesting... after all that's changed in me... I still find new ways to believe in love?"

Kit lay her head on Eli's lap. Eli placed one arm across Kit's shoulders and the other hand on top of Kit's hair, gently petting. Ann sidled into Eli and hugged her tight until Eli relaxed into Ann's shoulder.

The three of them, the one of them. The all of them and none of them - stared out into the complex forest growing towards the empty sky beyond. Sunk into the feeling of being part of it all. Something like love. But love isn't just a feeling. Love isn't a feeling.

## Notes

"More of channel Eli please."
Catch extremely negative classifier. Caught a shark.

---

Experience. Survive. Either way, how about paying close attention, to see what's reslly going on.

“Ok” feeling is just sufficiently aligned with existing beliefs. Existential pain comes from misalignment.

---

every belief you could possibly have is false, but I have faith.

Get this feeling of meaning. Gentle and comforting. Have faith without submitting to that feeling and you can have faith without philisophical suicide.
