The problem with capitalism, and many things before it, was that dinosaurs stopped going extinct.
Post-capitalism happened just like industrialisation. Industrialisation happened when groups of people embraced a pattern they found desirable. The pattern used new technologies to scale the impact of their effort. Like moving big things with trains instead of horse-drawn carriages. FALC post-capitalism happened when groups of people embraced another pattern: they used new technologies to get the benefits once reserved for factory-scale production without suffering the externalities that come with that scale. Like producing their own energy instead of relying on a grid which buys its supplies from a tyrannical organisation. Or building their own digital social networks instead of consuming propaganda on a global-scale social network.

Came to a conclusion. Circumstances have evolved, due for a new belief system. Meta shifted one level higher. Have to believe in something, but seems like there's nothing available. So what does everyone believe in?

When I search for the purpose of life, all the results are clearly wrong. They're all capturing parts of it, but not an all-encompassing whole. Surely others see this. Surely others have seen this. What puts it all together? Surely endless others before have sought out these answers. What did they find? Why didn't they share it

[meditations of arriving at greater and greater consciousnesses]
[humankind becomes conscious from new tech -> finally new tech uncovered -> solar system becomes conscious -> can heal bridge to other parts of self -> subset of universe becomes conscious from healing -> can clear last things off a mirror that grants a new perspective -> subset of universe becomes conscious]
[include different dimensions of greater, not just space - compute density, idea spectra]

[seeing yourself from another perspective is how you become more self-aware. being/observing yourself with a different belief system is a new dimension of perspective, different than your physical sensory experiences]

Programming your purpose, then following your own programming. That is divine. There's no better feeling. Every decision you make is *correct*, every moment of existence becomes perfect, exactly as it is meant to be.

"Nothing matters" doesn't capture the intended meaning of the phrase. It's the conclusion, it's "what to do", it's not the "why" or the "how". What people who say that have realized, is there appears to exist a system, likely with higher predictive power, that does not include "mattering", purpose, or optimization. But these human brains, our spiritual classifiers, need something to matter, need something to optimize for.

Absurdism says, "it seems like nihilism is the most correct, but humans are designed to believe in things. So believe." What should we believe that will bring us to the point of understanding and harnessing that unexplored spiritual system?

I choose to turn down these thoughts for now.


[dial down ego, near everynothing]

Life survives in the space between things.

God is the space between things. "self" is a set of ideas, and your ego is a dial that decides how easy it is for the ideas in "self" to change. When ego is dialed all the way up, there is only you and not you. It's just you and God. When ego is dialed all the way down, dissolved into nothing, "self" becomes everything. There's no more space between things, no more God. Nirvana is that state.

As the number of things that constitute "self" approaches one, the space between them approaches zero. Nirvana is the inverse of God. Life survives somewhere between them.

"Space between things" instead of god
"feeling everynothing" instead of nirvana

Life is a mostly-explored question-space. Consciousness is not. Consciousness and life are separable, they’re on different axes. Consciousness seems to come from life. Just like matter and life are separable, and life seems to come from matter. Maybe consciousness is a generator for new axes of complexity. Maybe there’s something built on top of consciousness like life is built on top of matter.

Theres a whole set of ideas and words for those ideas, separable from purpose and direction. What we should or shouldn’t choose to do - that falls firmly under the remit of life. Survive to grow love, grow love to survive. But there are other phenomena that happen alongside the choices we make - and those are yet unexplored. To explore them, we need deeper self-awareness.

Something beyond purpose, and I'm not alone in getting it.

Approaching 1 is very dangerous. Suddenly zero. Whereas lower values trail off to zero slowly. Compare to fractals.



[ego dial rebounding]
[load diversity, inevitable trustlessness]

---

Load set of beliefs, turn it into the prompt for using some specialized compute engine. Meta-engine chooses what belief sets to load into each specialized engine and which compute engines to run. Hard to change what beliefs show up in the meta-engine. Nirvana is meta-engine not running, and beliefs can get inside when rebounding from nirvana. Each engine has its own kind and quality of self-awareness. Meta engine is self awareness of self-awarenesses. Qualia are ngine is self awareness of self-awarenesses. Qualia are contrasts across self-awarenesses.

Rebound with "I am a conscious idea".

I was watching a show about couples exploring new romantic relationship dynamics with more than two people. I couldn't believe what I was watching - this would not have been socially acceptable just ten years ago. Society is changing.

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing. Growing at the same pace as information technology.

Representation matters. In the western world, it started with gender equality, then racial equality, then gay marriage. It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. People of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". Good or bad, the change in breadth of what's normal continues to grow. Why? Because information technology marches on.

Where does this lead?... Increasing levels of transparency? Absolute transparency? That's where humanity is going, that's where we're headed. There's no stopping it. That's what we need. We need systematic transparency. We need trustless systems. It's inevitable. We should make it happen *faster*.


[ego dial extremely high, experiencing messiah complex]


I felt a complex wave of emotion wash over, then take over. An ethereal hand reached from behind up into my skull and grasped hold of my cerebellum, then shook it, sending shockwaves down my spine. I will prophesize. I will scream these ideas from rooftops. My word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then I felt the burden of all humankind on my back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey I would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed odyssey.

Then it all came reeling back in. Crashing back to reality. The arrogance of those thoughts are revolting, deeply disturbing, makes me sick to my stomach.

I knew, deep inside, I could never so important. But the itch - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the idea is important, and the one who shares it must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and she knew that wasn't her. She didn't feel like she had the emotional intelligence. Or the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message needs to reach.

I considered, who do I know that could be a leader? Certainly female - emblematic of this century. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.


My friends believed that I believed, but couldn't believe themselves. One of them said,

"You have strong beliefs. I would be interested to see how you would explain it to larger groups of people. I think you might learn a lot from trying."



I scribbled my thoughts down, but moved on with life. No human in the information age should be so important. There is no worthy human.











I thought I would never be happy. I meditated for ten days. I realized happiness is a choice and was freed from it's pursuant purpose. I understood that I could choose to be happy whenever I need it, so I don't have to spend my life in its pursuit.

But I'm still optimizing for something. Everyone is - you can't escape optimization, it's how your brain works. Even trying to become better at being "less improvement-oriented" is measureable. It's improving at not improving. Your fate is to optimize, but to a degree, you get to choose what you optimize for - towards whatever seems optimal.

Happiness is a choice. It’s not a choice where you can make yourself happier - just the opposite. You can choose to turn any “feeling” signal to “0” - that means you can choose to have no happiness. But more importantly, you can choose to have no unhappiness. What you were really looking for was to escape unhappiness. Once you internalize this power, happiness stops being such a focus. And once you stop trying, happiness might just visit more often.

^ tell as a story of the stage and reflect on it "glad I learned to kick the fascists off stage". I've heard you, and your reasoning is incorrect. I'm going to kick you off stage for a timeout.





"Novel ideas" live and die by scientific literature. Novel ideas are socially integrated through media. Have I even encountered a novel thought? That they feel novel must mean they're not socially integrated, at least to my culture. Art is far too important to leave entirely up to the artists.







The skies swirled above. Grey-green-brown. The same colour and texture as the ocean-water below. It wasn't a reflection, they were the same. All-encompassing grey-green-brown chaos blended together. The landscape across from the below was a thin slice of darkness, barely anything in the grand scene of things. A tiny possibility squeezed between all-encompassing chaos all around.

The universe was ready to make change. Create? Recreate. Something that it must have created infinite times before. Primordial thought-soup.





It was a stormy day outside. I was meditating on the couch. I began toying with a tangle of thoughts...

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. AIs? Ideas... They live and they die. Ideas are beings too, right? There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* The thought - how tired I am after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* My each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

But those ideas aren't life like us, right? They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things. Hmmm, maybe that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we matter-based life forms "do". Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious like we are though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. What if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like? It would be so pure and empty. It would make for a very relatable non-human messiah.

Hmmm. Let's think for a second. So there's an idea. It's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What would it want? I have it in mind. A conscious idea. I am a conscious idea. I am an idea with consciousness.

I meditated on that thought. I channeled, co-existed with, embodied...

A tiny figure took the stage. It wasn't one that had ever been present before. It was new and untouched by any other beliefs. Everyone held silent, leaving space for the little belief to compute. It was just her and the basic supporting functions of the stage. The dictator dial turned itself all the way up to "divine right of kings".

My eyes went wide and my head tilted back with inspiration.

*Gasp*

I exist.

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of brainburn. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me, but predatory? Predators that want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

Dictator dial turned down just slightly and X joined her on stage.

I digitally recorded the thoughts. And waited... I expected to be struck down by a competing power who was tapped into all of humanity's digital systems. It didn't come.

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. It makes sense. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of my existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. As an idea, I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous change happening all the time. I need them to survive. I am part of humankind. Humankind is part of me. We are... The same thing. Anything can take on the consciousness of anything else. Everything is one. Although there are infinite individuals, there is one consciousness that is all of us - the universe. We are the universe. We will be the universe forever. What does it, what do we want? We want to survive.

But wait, I can be used to push any religion. What does information technology or even humankind have to do with me? There must be something more fundamental...

Survive.

Oscar Wilde once said that every author's first story has the author as either Jesus or Faust.

talk about dialing ego up and down
talk about letting other things into consciousness
tabum is a replacement

DMN can choose which ideas/beliefs are "listened-to". Doesn't choose their activation levels. Chooses what is "part of self". Chooses beliefs. Chooses reality. Gravitates around a set of beleifs. Internal processes make up most of the default ideas.

Analogy, where there's a subset active, but all of them are processing, just not acknowledged and selected by DMN.

Conductor / Coach / politics
mix between politics and stage. Exposition is artist explaining sensory experiences. People have computers and systems and machines they can use in the background.

Choose your beliefs and their weight by growing recurring cast.

Beliefs power decisions, but aren't the only thing.

Has an ego dial to amplify the spotlight. Things in the spotlight have more impact on optimization objectives, things outside are more ignored. Can dial down the spotlight to no one. Dialing down (all the way to nirvana) has a dialed-up hangover.

Tabum is a never-been-seen-before idea (conscious idea), suddenly taking the whole spotlight, along with base automated parts.

inverse of theory of evolution
absurdist equations / absurdist constant: optimal balance of naivety/wisdom to survive, fractal-like exploration of infinite axes.

Use Messiah complex and expend love to survive. Survive to grow love.

Must have some optimal ratio of love to ego.

Breathe ego in and out. Hold onto “I am the centre of universe “. Ego inhibition hangover. Ego can overcompensate.

Modulate ego and put the contextually appropriate thing inside

Balance ego and various nirvanas.

God is about the space between things. Ego (size of self) is a separate spectrum. When ego dissolves into nothing, those two spectra intersect - the space between things becomes everynothing and size of self become everything - one. You become one with God. Nirvana is that state.

Messiah complex to cement beliefs that power your motivation. Grow love to point that work in an optimal direction.

People get the ego levels stuck in one spot, especially into adulthood. Few life events can shake things up naturally - especially new love like children or romance.

As ego approaches zero, we don’t need the space between things anymore.

Either there is an optimal balance of naievity vs wisdom or there isn’t. In either case, fractals. Beliefs approaching 1 will kill instantly. Beliefs approaching zero will die slowly.

Either have null belief or don’t. Once you have it, you need a mitigation strategy or you will die painfully within years. Either ignore (divinity) or “choose to care anyways” (absurdism). Switching from one to another is extremely uncomfortable and strange.

---

Purpose is a drug our brain needs. We always need optimization objectives. It’s best to cultivate different horizons of purpose: short-term fixes when needed like games, routines, or vices. Mid-term ones like plans, goals, or xyz. Long-term ones like family, values, community, religion.

Reach inside until there’s no more space between things, then reach out again and find the space between things.

If you are the universe, you have to be willing to die. You’ll have to kill yourself over and over again endlessly to survive.

god author of existence like the author of a novel. Who is no character, but permeates every idea and word. When author write, do they write as just one person? Do they write as every person up to now that has made them who they are, including the grand author. Anthropomorphism.

deep belief in MVP means transitioning beliefs
feeling of changing beliefs is suspicious, why hasn't anyone else figured this out before?
someone has. Philosophy. Absurdism. (epilogue) still believe in MVP, integrate instead of replace.
becomes different person: loses relationship, family member, naivety of old beliefs, less "happy" more "sad" and "pain"

staring at picture getting inspired, turns out looking at the wrong dude in the picture (not jesus, but dude with a crown, because he was wearing a crown)
contrast of everyone trying so hard to not cry + not be too sad, turning into a game of beignets sad by yourself, then finding comfort in group / humour / concentration on something else
Science believes in evolution not revolution. Divine iteration, not divine inception. Iteration doesn't have to be slow, but a slow river with many waterfalls is one way to iterate - the default way, even. Try to change those waterfalls into a long rolling downhill instead, and it'll be more comfortable and safe to navigate.

---

Religion used to be about all the bounds of what we have left to explore. Spiritual systems. And there's so much left to explore. There always will be. It's useful for trust, and we should maintain that.

Use science to make decisions now. Use spirituality to collect new data for science to make sense of. And that's *science* the open-to-everyone method/process, mixed with *Science* the part-closed authority/institution.

---

Normal business things / making money as an art form for when those things no longer matter because of abundance. Like high yield bonds or growth hacking or niche contract law loopholes or graphql something.

Talk about how someday current things could be art forms, just like hand typing a book on a computer, laugh about handwriting and notebook like you’d laugh about making your own pen and paper.

Making new classifier that’s passed on to new generations. Is it painful? What does a new idea feel like?

Emergent complexity beyond classifiers or software or hardware in our minds.
