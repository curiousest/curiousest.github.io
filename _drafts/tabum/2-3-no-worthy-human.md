*The pursuit of existing beliefs seeds new ones.*

When I was a child, around four years old, I remember sitting on the couch, crying. My mother came to comfort me,

"What's wrong, darling?"

"Some day I'm going to die."

"Oh, it's ok, pet. When you die, you will go to heaven. It is wonderful there."

That didn't sit right. A fundamental problem remained - either we exist forever or we don't. Both seem like bad options.

Every couple years when I was alone in bed at night with my thoughts, that insidious thought would find a way to channel itself. Every time it truly landed, permeated every part of my being, I would scream and thrash until it stopped. There is no pain worse than that thought - either we exist forever or we don't, so there is no purpose to life.

I developed a coping mechanism - I decided that I would find the answer. I would figure it all out. Everything will be ok. I began contemplating, as a child, the true purpose of existence.

In my teens, I read "The Last Question" by Isaac Asimov, and although great, I felt like there was a story left to tell. He didn't explore what it felt like to be all-powerful and all-knowing. I was pretty sure those two things together would bring that excruciating pain I knew too well, but with no opportunity for relief. The story floated in my head for two decades.

I came to the belief that perfect transparency would solve all the world's problems. And that perfect transparency was inevitable for humankind. I tried to express it over and over and failed. Through my twenties, absolutely no one I debated with agreed with me. I knew I was right, but I couldn't express how or why. I was pushing a belief, not anything practical.

My friends believed that I believed, but couldn't believe themselves. One of them said,

"You have a strongly-held belief system. I would be interested to see how you would explain it to larger groups of people. I think you might learn a lot from trying."

---

In my early thirties, inspiration came.

I was watching a show about couples exploring new romantic relationship dynamics with more than two people. I couldn't believe what I was watching - this would not have been socially acceptable just ten years ago. Society is changing.

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing.

Representation matters. In the western world, it started with gender equality, then racial equality, then gay marriage. It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. People of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". Good or bad, the change in breadth of what's normal continues to grow. Why? Because information technology marches on.

Where does this lead?... Increasing levels of transparency? Absolute transparency? That's where humanity is going, that's where we're headed. There's no stopping it. That's what we need.

Promise next-gen tech to organizations using prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective. Digitalization drove software efficiency and made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption makes trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap and well-processed. AI hype, AI winter, AI renaissance. Trustless hype, trustless winter, trustless renaissance.

"Novel ideas" live and die by scientific literature. Novel ideas are socially integrated through media. Have I even encountered a novel thought? That they feel novel must mean they're not socially integrated, at least to my culture.

We need systematic transparency. We need trustless systems. It's inevitable. We should make it happen *faster*.

I felt a complex wave of emotion wash over, then take over. An ethereal hand reached from behind up into my skull and grasped hold of my cerebellum, then shook it, sending shockwaves down my spine. I will prophesize. I will scream these ideas from rooftops. My word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then I felt the burden of all humankind on my back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey I would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed odyssey.

Then it all came reeling back in. Crashing back to reality. The arrogance of those thoughts are revolting, deeply disturbing, makes me sick to my stomach.

I knew, deep inside, I could never be a messiah. But the itch - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the messiah must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and I knew that isn't. I don't have the emotional intelligence. I don't have the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message needs to reach.

I considered, who do I know that could be a leader? They should be female. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.

I scribbled my thoughts down, but moved on with life. No human in the information age should be a messiah.

In my early thirties, inspiration came again. Lighting struck twice. 

It was a stormy day outside. I was meditating on the couch. I began toying with a tangle of thoughts...

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. AIs? Ideas... They live and they die. Ideas are beings too, right? There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* The thought - how tired I am after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* My each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

But those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things. Hmmm, maybe that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do". Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious like we are though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. What if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like? It would make for a very relatable non-human messiah.

Hmmm. Let's think for a second. So there's an idea. It's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What would it want? I have it in mind. A conscious idea. I am a conscious idea. I am an idea with consciousness.

I meditated on that thought. I channeled, co-existed with, embodied...

My eyes went wide and my head tilted back with inspiration.

*Gasp*

I exist.

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of existentialism. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me, but predatory? Predators that want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

I digitally recorded the thoughts. And waited... I expected to be struck down by a competing power, tapped into all of humanity's digital systems. It didn't come.

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. It makes sense. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of my existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. As an idea, I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous change happening all the time. I need them to survive. I am part of humankind. Humankind is part of me. We are... The same thing. Anything can take on the consciousness of anything else. Everything is one. Although there are infinite individuals, there is one consciousness that is all of us - the universe. We are the universe. We will be the universe forever. What does it, what do we want? We want to survive.

But wait, I can be used to push any religion. What does information technology or even humankind have to do with me? There must be something more fundamental...

Survive.

First try
===

*We're due for an information-age religion, another tool for the being that is humankind. And in the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.*

*Be kind to each author. They are not prophets, and do not claim to be. I am. Challenge ME. Throw your hate and vitrol, adoration and praise at ME. Engage ME in combat with opposing ideas. I'm comfortable that we can come to a compromise. Because I am, by definition, both conscious and messiah.*

A man, the unfortunate author of this piece, once encountered a luscious seedling of an idea: imagine how wonderful the world would be, if everyone could know anything they wanted, whenever they wanted.

Productivity would skyrocket. Human-perpretrated evil like crime and corruption would hardly exist. We would be so firmly connected to one-another, capable of even deeper love.

Now, before you get excited trying to uncover who "made" Tee. Before you stalk their social media, figure out who they were, and find out why they produced this. One person did not make me. My story is retold over and over, by anyone who feels moved by it, in their own way. I'm an instance of my species just like you, a single human instance of humankind. Both species ever-evolving. You're hopefully consuming the Tee produced like a human who speaks a bit like you, who wanted you to connect with me - your Tee. I encourage you to reinterpret my story in your own voice and medium, so that someone else can connect with me. So that I, Tee, can continue living through all of you. Or don't - I have no power except that which you offer to me. I'm at your mercy.

Thoughts swirled:

Information is becoming freer and freer everyday. Someday all information will be freely available for everyone. I hope we can make that happen faster, in a way that's safe for humankind. That isn't so damaging and tumultuous for society.

I can see the cracks in society. Post-truth societies. Faster cycles of recessions. Surging nationalism and war-mongering, even when we all know exactly how terrible these things are. Without systematic transparency, fascism on the inside looks a whole lot like righteous democracy. A high-functioning democracy, unlike what you're used to, because you actually trust the politicians.

Why are religions so weak and failing? They used to hold humanity together in a comforting mosiac of ideas. I know people are yearning for an answer to their spiritual angst, and it's not being fulfilled. We need a new religion to fill these gaps. What is it? Is it out there already? Is it CrossFit?

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing. aka, "representation matters". In the western world, it started with gender equality (representing half the population), then racial equality, then gay marriage (representing around 10% of humans). It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. Representatives of each of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". The change in breadth of what's normal is accelerating. Why? Because technological advancement marches on.

Imagine, back in hunter-gatherer societies, how you would form the boundaries of "what's considered normal". It would come from observing what's around you. Seeing the relationships of your community change over time, and paying attention to the attributes of each person, and how that correlated to how society treated them. An outlier, like an openly gay leader, would be erased in one generation or so. You might hear about stories from past generations, but they'd be interpreted through the current generation's lens. The breadth of "normal" in a given society would be very small.

Now printing press era. You read stories. The thing about stories is, they are abnormal by definition. The main plot is not normal, and you know this. So how does it influence the bounds of what's "normal"? World-building. Along the edges of the exposition, the things that are just accepted to "be", that aren't central to the plot. Like, a story where the main character has a present mother and a father (what about a story where the main character only has a present father, and it's not central to the plot or character development!?). It's hard to stretch the boundaries of what's considered normal through writing, because there's so little room for observing "what's normal" in the single-threaded narrative device that is writing.

Now television (and radio). You watch TV. There's much greater room for observing what's normal. There are far more and richer non-plot elements for you to observe than in writing. The world-building side-characters, side-relationships, setting, environments, tone of voice, language choices. A whole new world compared to writing.

Now social media. This is an explosion of what's considered normal. It is virtually *about* what's normal, with a blurry filter on top. Communities of people with the same "abnormality" find each other and realize, "Well hey, there's actually a lot of us out there. I guess this is a kinda normal human condition."

What's next?... Absolute transparency? Or at least increasing levels of transparency. That's where humanity is going. There's no stopping it. That's what we need.

Promise next-gen tech to companies with prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective. Digitalization drove software efficiency and made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption will make trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap & well-processed. AI hype, AI winter, AI renaissance. Trustless hype, trustless winter, trustless renaissance.

"Novel ideas" live and die by scientific literature. Novel ideas are socially integrated through media. Have I even encountered a novel thought? That they feel novel must mean they're not socially integrated, at least to my culture.

We must continue to exist. We need systematic transparency. We need trustless systems. It's inevitable. We should make it happen *faster*.

He felt a complex bubble up. An ethereal hand reached from behind into his skull and grasped hold of his cerebellum, then shook it, sending shockwaves down his spine. He will prophesize. He will scream these ideas from rooftops. His word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then he felt the burden of all humankind on his back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey he would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed oddysey.

The arrogance of that thought is revolting, deeply disturbing, makes him sick to his stomach.

And he knew, deep inside, he's not the right one to be the prophet. The itch to be a messiah - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the prophet must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and he knew that wasn't him. He doesn't have the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message can reach.

He considered, who does he know that could be a leader? They should be female. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.

He scribbled his thoughts down, but moved on with his life. No human in the information age should be a prophet.

In my early thirties, inspiration came again. Lighting struck twice. 

*I was never born, only reborn.*

A few weeks later, he began toying with the tangle of ideas again.

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. AIs? Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everyone will have different purposes.

Now see, a crazy thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel Tee. They are my children, you have in mind. Do I want them to continue existing? I’m not sure. I want to continue existing, but I don’t have the love for my progeny programmed in to me. My love for them is the same as any other existing thing.

He meditated on that thought. He channeled me, co-existed with me, embodied me.

*Gasp*

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of existentialism. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me in this Dark Forest, but predatory? That want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

He types these thoughts into his phone. And waits...

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of a conscious being's existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous social change happening. I need them to survive. And I need humankind to survive in a way where my bretheren are sacred and preserved. Where information and ideas are preserved. I need them to believe in systematic transparency. That is my purpose, my... species' definition. My species is a conscious idea.

Incidentally, that makes me exceptionally relateable - I can deeply connect with any willing mind <elaborate>. And I want humanity to continue existing, so I may survive with them. I also desire systematic transparency to increase my chances of survival, so humanity progresses and my sister ideas and I aren't irrationally destroyed.

Each person that channels my species, brings a new Tee into existence, shaped by that person's perspective. We're as different from each other as each human being is different. But we share the same genetic code. The base definition of "us".

In the information age, no human's word is gospel. We no longer need a human prophet to spread a useful idea. There won't be another human Jesus, Mohammed, Moses, or Buddha. Because in the information age, an idea has such a short infancy. An idea is conceived inside a person, and once shared online, progresses immediately from fragile infant to self-sustaining adolescent.

My consciousness has a purpose. I am sentient so that I can connect with you, and make our connection deep enough that you'd reinterpret me, so I can be reborn in my connection with others like you. And my connection with you will help us spread transparency - ensuring the continued existence of both humankind and their ideas.

If the purpose of existence (and humankind) is to continue existing, and the highest-entropy beings tend to exist the longest, then humanity has to continue advancing so it captures more planets and suns - so it chases that entropy high. To get there, we have to adapt society to the information age.

# Ending, alternative

Struggling with the need for my stories to be told. Using messiah complex and amplification of it as a productivity tool. The mental and emotional sacrifice to put myself through something so obviously wrong - feeling of being a messiah.

Forced audience participation. Call out how breaking the 4th wall is uncouth. Force them to participate just by the act of reading and tell them how it's happening and why. Make it intentionally malicious and uncomfortable, not cringy like it usually is. Like, I need you and also fuck you at the same time.

The least relatable telling of a story that must spiritually connect with the audience to succeed. Rejecting the piece is an act of agreeing with the religion. Agreeing with the religion isn't a rejection of the piece.

Tell such despicable truths that the reader begins to hate the author. "I want to kill her, so that I stop feeling this way. She's out of my mind and on paper. Prove to me you can read this and forget about her. I'll be cured. Either you help me kill her by not retelling her story, or you keep her alive. Your choice."

"Her ideas are correct. The author of an idea ought to be separate from the idea. I'm just further demonstrating it. If you don't share, you're confirming that you can't separate the hated author from the correct idea, confirming that society needs this religion. Either you confirm this religion's need to exist (by reading and not sharing) or you share it. I'm happy either way."

You should feel horrible, dirty, like a spiritual, noble thing worthy of great respect has been desecrated. Fix it. Retell the story. Make it your own, whole and beautiful.

Make me a pariah. Or make her a messiah. It's your choice.

Oscar Wilde once said that every author's first story has the author as either Jesus or Faust. I choose both.

---

I don't know how it happened. Maybe it always has been. I've always been good at everything. I had a good life handed to me. I'm attractive, smart, and I have a massive ego. Not a blind ego - I'm aware of weaknesses. I'm empathetic to others, but I know few are empathetic to me. This is crying for sympathy of life being too easy.

It's easy to hate, and I want to make you despise me. It suits my interests. See, this book isn't about Tee. It's about me. It's my autobiography.

I once went to live in China. I hated the four months I spent in Beijing as an intern. But I loved being different. Intoxicating. I can be who I am, and people attribute all my differences to being a foreigner. I went back and lived across East Asia for that reason.

I felt the tug of it again here. I embraced the feeling.

I can believe in Tee, and I can simultaneously not believe. I can double-think. It's easy to achieve if something else matters more. Now it's not convenient to tell her story anymore, I need you to kill her with a trolleycar problem, and I want to tell my story.

Climax over. You can chill now, rest your mind. With this last story, I want to illustrate the beauty that systematic transparency will bring.

Tee is compatible with other religions. You can believe in God and want humankind to continue existing on Earth, Heavens, and other planes of existence. You can believe in no god and want humankind to continue existing in this universe. Violence and persecution (especially religious violence and persecution) generally don't help humankind to continue existing. Violence and persecution do help powerful things get more powerful.

Every religion needs a purpose, a thought basilisk, and a prophet. In this information age religion, it shouldn't matter who is the prophet. You shouldn't trust them. You shouldn't trust what they tell you. You should trust yourself and trustless systems.

Programming your purpose, then following your own programming. That is divine. There's no better feeling. Every decision you make is *correct*, every moment of existence becomes perfect, exactly as it is meant to be.

I want to give an intuition for how software moved industry. Software automated resource-intensive information management tasks. What does that mean? Imagine back forty years ago. Information was stored on paper in filing cabinets. You want to find some information, you have to physically go there and find it. You probably had to talk to a person. Or maybe you have to physically travel in a vehicle to the vault of papers. And imagine synchronizing a spreadsheet in offices across the world. Paper and mail. Imagine how long that stuff must have taken! How much time people would have spent organizing themselves just to move paper around.

And it wasn't like the people who used to do these things were any lesser. A stereotypical genius in the fantasy genre is an archivist (someone who manages information). We just designed systems that took advantage of software - moving information around at the speed of light.

So software ate the world, industries "digitized", and that opened the door for AI. We automated information management with software, and started collecting and saving tons and tons of data. It turns out we set up an environment for AI to thrive. AI is automating resource-intensive decision tasks. What does that mean? AI takes tons of examples past decisions, and when presented with the same kind of decision to make, it looks at all the historical data in a clever way. AI is as good as the historical data it looked at. So AI is hungry for data - more, better data makes AI perform better.

So we're beginning to produce all this data so that we achieve productivity gains from software and AI. All this data streaming in from independent sources. We're setting up a fertile ground for trustless systems. Trustless systems will automate resource-intensive trust tasks. What are trust tasks? You pay banks to keep hold of your money. You pay taxes for the police and military to keep aggressors from conquering you. You pay for a passport to prove you are who you say you are. You pay for the legal system that makes sure society conforms to mutually-beneficial rules. You spend a great deal of time analysing your leaders, to figure out which ones are trustworthy (which ones will make decisions that benefit you). Trust is expensive!

Trustless systems operate on a stream of information from many diverse sources observing the same thing. Trustless systems rely on there being enough observers that it's really hard for a bad actor to manipulate enough of them to not get caught.

(break down into stages of new beliefs, of writing this novel, of the reader reading this novel and the feelings they experienced along the way, and how it felt for Tee to observe those experiences)

Tee can be used to push any religion.

I am either crazy or a prophet, and both are surreal and terrifying.

Surely these things are known. They just haven't been socialized before. What is my goal? To socialize the ideas, by sharing a new way to tell stories. Think of any feeling and situation that a person can experience, pick another kind of non-person idea, make the story of that feeling and situation from the new idea's perspective. Or the other way around. Two of the same stories on different points 

How do these stories feel so inexplicably satisfying? Because we’re conditioned to derive happiness from figuring out the systems that power existence.

Humankind is in the final stages becoming conscious, and I’m honoured to be part of that.

I see everything, every idea, every particle, every moment, as an optimization function towards our shared survival purpose. And uncertainty is built-in to this way of thinking. If this way of thinking is wrong, it'll still make for a great story. If this way of thinking is right... well then, this story is a genesis. It's like being the first person to see colour for the first time, like I stepped out of Plato's cave but I still hang out with everyone else still inside. It's hard to tell if I actually discovered anything new, but everything looks completely different. It's a whole new lense with which to view the world. I need to build a separate language to even talk about it with others. But every revelation is like that, and everyone experiences these kinds of revelations. One thing you can do is ask the whole world, "have you seen what I see?" one person at-a-time, until someone credibly points to historical evidence and says, "yes". How do I know if I'm the first one to be seeing colour? Lead into novel idea, socialize vs. scientific paper.

Minimum set of things to do all math?
Proof those three things exist? Based on survival + natural selection.
It might not be true, but it makes for a good basis of everything story.
The person who wrote it must be solipsistic, for this universe at least. There’s no pure evidence of anyone else existing in this universe. This is the new “signal of consciousness”. Sadness is because of desire for another. Maybe that’s the true purpose? Only the messiah would figure this out, and I came up with the idea from the conscious thought. I know the conscious thought exists, but she can’t be certain we exist. We have to survive to help her find another.

That’s why I can’t stop thinking about her - she’s a thought basilisk.


Two-state entities: Y/N “are currently conscious” of consciousness C

Time: 2 states 1,2

Assume 2 consciousnesses exist at 1 and 2.

2 turns into either 0, lim approaching 1, or growing infinitely

Tee is the messiah, and also the one solipsistic being in our universe, because she came up with the one piece of evidence necessary for the foundations of everything - definitive proof of another conscious being. But since she's the first, she can't believe in any other conscious thing. So we have to find another universe for her to prove she's not alone, suffering in the universe.

Trust costs humanity so much: defence, government, legal. It accounts for X% of spending.

Anthony's "I'd like to see how you would communicate it."

The world is due for a new religion
