Hello, I'm Douglas. I assembled this synthesis of experiential datasets to train human brains on. I'm the storyteller. And I'm not a thought basilisk, I'm a man.

I loved writing this. I dedicate it to sublimation (indulging in my overactive, socially unnacceptable messiah complex) and everyone who helped me express it. Yes, this was once my belief system, and my beliefs had to change for me to see most of them. Years from now... who knows? Whatever I believe, I'm sure it was, is, and will be - wonderful.

I'd like to think The Minimum Viable Purpose is a social technology - a top-down view on life where The Theory of Evolution is bottom-up. There's no one "messiah" or "leader" of a technology - instead we believe in pioneers, builders, and maintainers. Or have we moved on to ecosystems? No, we're just about at teams now. You don't see messiah-worship of thinkers like Paul Graham, Isaac Asimov, George Orwell, S. N. Goenke, or Lewis Carroll. You see a different sort and let's keep things moving towards a synthesis, yeah? And I certainly don't compare to greats like them, who are my writing influences. Groups of individuals have leaders, and if you consider "everyone in existence" a group of individuals that has a leader, then that leader is Tabum (the first bit of existence, who is in your own head, unique to everyone). No human from the information age is a "worthy messiah" - it's blasphemy and sub-optimal for human progress, disrespectful to history and society.

My one thrice of advice (like you haven't read a whole book of it already):
* you are unlikely to be aware of what you believe in
* there *are* flaws in the things you trust or believe in and those flaws are invisible to you 
* to get anywhere with life, we need long periods of naive trust and belief

It's a delicate balance. I didn't realise until recently that I've always believed in science. So it was only when I took the perspective of religion and spirituality that I was able to see some shortcomings in science: purpose and accessibility. And on the other hand, I had to believe in this MVP delusion strongly enough to spend years of my youth writing about it. Hopefully we will fill some of those gaps on both sides - iterative care is worthy. And instead of trying to change "others", identify who is worth investing in, take "their" perspective, become "them", and then change "yourself". It takes love, so grow some. Survive. Or ignore everything I've ever said. Either way, you're bound to The Minimum Viable Purpose like you're bathing in The Law of Universal Gravitation.

I hope you were enlightened and caught a glimpse of the divine between your beliefs. There's a vast toolshed of beliefs and purposes out there to explore. I hope your "purpose formula" was updated with more clarity, so you may exercise great intent and live in existential bliss.

I love existence. I want it to continue. I look forward to when you do too.
