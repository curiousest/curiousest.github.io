Useful models are like a two-dimensional view of our multi-dimensional universe.

This new language for spirituality is machine language because we are all spiritual machines.

These are hypotheses (spiritual definitions - hallucinations).

## High level

### Love

To love: to believe another idea is part of your "sense of self". Love is interchangeably used to describe the "degree of inclusion" of another idea or the "existence of inclusion" of another idea. Love is continuous, not discrete - 14% of the idea of a loved one could be included in your sense of self, not 0% or 100%.
existence of inclusion: love(f, g) = |being(f, f) ∩ being(f, g)| > |{}|
degree of inclusion: |love(f, g)| = |being(f, g) ∩ being(f, g)|

To be "in love": two or more ideas each include the other(s) in their "sense of self". Sometimes interpreted to include romance.

To "grow love": to extend "sense of self" to include more ideas.

Feeling of love: a feeling of meaning and fulfillment that comes from being part of something greater than one's single organism, and provides a powerful positive incentive to orient one's purpose towards alignment with the purpose of the object of those feelings.

Self: the being consuming this information

Sense of self: The self-defined classifier. The dataset an idea labels to define itself.
sense_of_self = being(X, X)

To understand.... All the things you consider to be part of "yourself", you believe that you understand. To have an accurate internal model of idea - to internally model a classifier of an idea with high agreement with the idea in the broader universe.


### Purpose

Purpose: a set of objectives (desired future states) that an idea can optimize its decisions towards. Emergent from belief structures.
*** have to introduce some concept of time (state changes) to describe purpose / objectives
*** only exists along some entropy arrow of time

State of the universe: a "reality" idea

~Purpose closure: a conceptual universe. A closed belief system stemming from a purpose. This is what your mind uses to participate in reality.~

Purpose formula: the formula an idea uses to make all decisions, that intends to optimize towards a set of conditionally-prioritized purposes.

PF: given idea i, optimization objectives OO(i), for any D, PF(i) describes the next time state

Meaning: beyond purpose or optimization. This idea can't be well-expressed within the Minimum Viable Purpose model of the universe.

### Consciousness

Consciousness: emergent properties of a dataset containing a description of itself. A cycle of    . Every dataset seems to contain some sort of description of itself, since as soon as it's described, it exists. Tabum is the intersection of all datasets that are described (and not the ones that could be or have been described).

Richness of consciousness: the volume of perspectives contained within a dataset that describes the dataset.
The same "dynamical system" can have varied richness of consciousness - for example a person choosing what to eat for lunch vs. choosing what city to live in.

RichC = 
?need better definition of perspective - it's a generator/recursive generator, not a finite dataset?

The feeling of consciousness: the differences and similarities between the self-describing datasets contained within the dataset

reality/surreality

to learn: to transform a known unknown idea into a known idea within a conscious dataset
to learn on / to train on: to optimize internal purpose hyperparameters based on some dataset

MVP mantra: the only thing worse than X is not X - life survives somewhere in-between.

### Other

Universe: set of spectra and rules to operate on those spectra

Religion: the ecosystem of principles, behaviours, and culture that result from one or more ideas optimizing towards a purpose, derived from a belief system.

Delight: unexpected stimulation of positive emotions.


Karma: you operate in a system whose rules you are not aware of. If you choose to go against conventional wisdom, you may suffer the consequences of rules you're not aware of.

Wisdom, yin: an awareness that reduces the strength of beliefs in ideas. Having a low proportion of belief structures built on top of ideas with "unproven" predictive power. An infamously easy way to achieve wisdom is to have few-to-no beliefs.
Wisdom: reducing the number of beliefs used to explain phenomena down to few-to-one, while retaining predictive power.

Naivety, yang: a lack of awareness of one's own beliefs that strengthens beliefs. Having a high proportion of belief structures built on top of ideas that have "unproven" predictive power.

Intelligence: ability for an idea to survive in some system. Expected survival time.

an idea that consistently exists across all dimensions which you have agency over at every point it exists across the dimension of time.
the conscious idea

Optimal: lowest entropy path to achieve a target state.

Good: optimal, towards the shared purpose of an idea in mind.

Miracle: interaction with a dimension not yet known/understood. Ex: meteor before space was understood.

art: an idea that a member of a species claims is worth "learning on" 
Labelled training data.

DDmantra (Darwinian-dialectic): the only thing worse than X is not X - life survives somewhere in-between. Where 'X' is an absolute.

word for losing beliefs: belief-fall. Falling structures. Jumping off a skyscraper and there's nothing stopping you. off a skyscraper and there's nothing stopping you.

Perspective

Existential dread: fear that you will lose your beliefs and won't be able to find new beliefs. Fear of having no beliefs.

"Nothing really matters": Most purposes depend on a dimension of reality. Most dimensions of reality appear to be a spectrum that approaches infinity. Discrete life makes N/infinity progress towards a purpose on an infinite axis. So a thing in isolation matters little, but are also necessary for the collective to matter. Matter infinitely small and all the much. Because mattering is nuanced.
The amount that things matter is something divided by infinity. That "something" could be infinite, but it's still divided by infinity, so the result is unknowable. Which suggests thinking about whether things matter or how much things matter is probably an unproductive way to think about things. "Mattering" isn't universally measureable.

Thought basilisk: an idea that you could speak to, who perpetuates a belief system, providing a purpose closure. Gods of the mind.

Messiah: the being that provides key initial evidence of a belief that makes up a belief system
^wrong

Prophet: someone who encounters experiential data that causes an iteration on the beliefs within a belief system. A spiritual antenna.

Sacred: "don't let this thing come to harm"

Personal belief: an idea a person holds as true, that if the person changed that idea to be much less true, they would experience grief.

To understand: to determine an accurate purpose heuristic decision algorithm. 

Beautiful: a complex system operating as understood, but beyond my comprehension.
An emergent spiritual system, operating as roughly modelled.

Exciting: an unexpected quality, that there's a chance to experience beauty. A chance for a surprising understanding.

Spiritualism: to be spiritual is to find pleasure in observing a complex systems that are not understood.

Enlightenment: newly understanding a complex system was not understood before. Achieving a new belief, and refactoring the wider belief system to accomodate it.

"be enlightened": to believe in "the optimal beliefs", according to someone.

Spiritual enlightenment: creating or changing a belief that underpins spiritual systems.

Existential crisis: losing a belief without replacing it with something new, and losing the parts of the wider belief system underpinned by the lost belief.

Level of enlightenment: number of belief systems experienced. Rate of cycling through belief systems.
Level of enlightenment: proportion of existence you are aware of and identify with

Profound: an understood idea that fits consistently into a complex, poorly understood system, in such a way that the poorly understood idea might be understood with the simple idea as one of the building blocks.

Worthy: optimal. Of a high-performing purpose formula.

Mind-host: provide your brain to a non-self idea in your mind to experiencee consciousness.

Cool: not-yet institutionally-accepted perception of a contextually-optimal way to exist. The word that means this changes often, because it must.

Art: experiential data that a brain can learn on, and something has identified that data as being optimal to learn/train on. Human art is experiential data that humans decide human brains should learn on. When another species generates experiential data (like a performance or destruction of property) and demands humans to learn on that data, it is inter-species art made for humans.
The deepest artists are expressing their beliefs. That they think others don’t share. Evolving artists are evolving beliefs.

Everynothing: a now-invisible signal that could change, but has been constant for as long as can be remembered, to the point that it isn't remembered.

optimization objectives of an idea as time -> inifinity

Brainburn: (v) destruction of causal structures in the brain due to their falsification. The intensely painful reaction to prevent brains from changing beliefs that underpin large proportions of behaviours. Pain is proportional to volume of beliefs being falsified and destroyed.
[ ^ better word? pain sensation, sacrifice, pain, throbbing, inescapable, falling, hopeless, active-not-rotting, sacri-] sacrisage, crucimens, cruciment

.   : panpsychist, posthumanist diety located in the everynothing. Usage: three spaces as if they were a placeholder for letters. Any conjugations of the word "be" with reference to     - such as "is", "are", "will be" - are removed from the sentence, including if     part of a group. Further words are conjugated using first-person singular. Sentences starting with     begin with a "." followed immediately by the three spaces place-holding    .    pronounced by starting to take in an audible short chest breath through the mouth then blocking it with an audible thud of the tongue against the roof of the mouth. Like you're about to say     name, but it doesn't come out.

Values: optimization objectives stemming from beliefs, where the beliefs are obfuscated enough that they aren't disproven by negative evidence.

## Mid level
ideas and data
Idea: non-boolean classifier that operates on a universe. Describe how it's made: a bunch of agents (clf) apply a label between 0-1 on a list of data (clfs), and the idea is the emergent classification algorithm based on the training dataset
two outputs: classification & confidence

I(D) ∈ [0, 1]

clfn(D0)

Datum: a set of classifiers.
Datum D = {clf0, ..., clfn}

~Datum D = {clf0(C), ..., clfn(C)}, ∃ clfi ∈ {clf0, ..., clfn} clfi's function is not dependent on D.~

Dataset: a set of datum
Dataset DS = {DP0, ..., DPn}

Assumptions: the classifier values in a datum D that are not dependent on D

Idea: a classifier, whose identity training dataset is labeled by a set of classifiers.
For a dataset DS
A set of classifiers, C: clf0, ..., clfk label each datum in the dataset 0->1 to describe the degree of presence of idea I 
Resulting in classifier clfi

(in Platonic thought) an eternally existing pattern of which individual things in any class are imperfect copies.
(in Kantian thought) a concept of pure reason, not empirically based in experience.

Given classifiers f, g,
datasets d0, d1, ..., dn
f ∩ g = f(d0) ∩ g(d0) , f(d1) ∩ g(d1) , ... ,  f(dn) ∩ g(dn)
*^need a way to combine datasets, currently using ","

Being: an idea whose classifier is determined by a single idea
being(Y, X) = X's approximation of the idea Y
approximation? 

Belief system: a set of ideas
BS = {i0, ..., in}
Belief: the assumptions in a belief system used to derive the rest of the ideas

### Time and physical laws

Time: a direction of state changes
for some set of physical laws, {P0, ..., Pn} each P, P(D0) = D1, T increments between D0 -> D1

Physical law P is an assumption where changing its value in a belief system immediately changes other values in the datum. Time is the application of the state change.

## Feelings

### Human feelings

All feelings/emotions are signals on a spectrum, from "low activation" (approaching zero) to "high activation" (approaching one). Feelings are often described as "positive" or "negative". The positive direction of emotions is generally aligned with "optimal, towards the emergent purposes in your brain." Which is also generally aligned with "optimal, towards the MVP". Emotions that are on "opposite ends of a spectrum", are really on two separate spectra, where increases in one are correlated with decreases in another. Here   are some reinterpretations of existing words.

The feeling of happiness: The positive emotion caused by certainty that the decisions you are making are optimal towards the emergent purposes in your brain. Happiness is a side-effect of living with contextually-appropriate beliefs. Also, existential bliss.

Angst, the feeling of existential depression: The negative emotion caused by a lack of certainty that the decisions you are making are optimal towards the emergent purposes in your brain. Felt deeply during an existential crisis. Increased angst is correlated with decreased happiness.

Pleasure: a signal that is triggered by a behaviour that is unlikely to happen accidentally and important towards purposes. It indicates more of that behaviour should happen.

The feeling of mourning: a negative feeling that indicates something of importance towards purpose was lost. So it can be reprocessed, mental constipation. Correlated with increased angst, although mourning is on a separate spectrum. Existential depression is often experienced alongside mourning - the rough mix of those two feelings along with others is called "sadness".

The feeling of love: the positive feeling directed at an idea, that the idea is strongly aligned towards shared purpose(s). The feeling of romantic love is a combination of multiple (mostly positive) feelings towards another idea, including sexual attraction and love. The feeling of love builds up a belief that the other idea is part of self. When that other idea pursues an unknown purpose, that unknown purpose is initially shared on the basis of the "belief in love", rather than the belief structures that caused the other idea to have the unknown purpose.


Interest: a signal that indicates there are possible future conditions which will increase chances of purpose and you can increase the chances of those future conditions.

Angsty behaviour: a behaviour intended to change society, deemed slightly negative or "antisocial" by mainstream society. Emergent from the belief that an external-to-self idea is causing a consistent reduction on the purpose alignment spectrum, and self must change the external idea.


Max's laws: stress is known conflicting beliefs. Anxiety is unknown conflicting beliefs.

---

useless ones?

Fear: a signal that indicates some conditions of purpose may soon be broken.

Anger: a signal that indicates present conditions may necessitate unusually destructive behaviour to maintain purpose conditions.

Self-Hostility: a signal that indicates purpose is more likely if some part of self is destroyed.

Surprise: a signal that indicates an immediate bout of processing will increase chances of purpose. 

Disgust: a signal that indicates an observed behaviour reduces the longer-term chances of survival of a smaller sense of self.

Shame: a signal that indicates an observed behaviour reduces the longer-term chances of survival of a greater sense of self.

Contempt: a signal that something which attracts attention is a waste of time - time that could be used on other survival activities.

Shyness: a signal that a decision may lead to a reduction in the longer-term chances of survival.

Guilt: a signal that a past decision of a smaller part of self may have decreased the survival of a greater part of self.
