*Modern management structures productive work into repeatable tasks. Software automates information management tasks. Artificial intelligence automates decision tasks. Trustless systems automate trust tasks. Each one begets the next. Information technology marches on.*


At the root of every disruptive productivity improvement is a real-world async await on a human.
Because at the root of every productivity improvement is a context switch. And humans are very slow at context switching.

What conditions made it possible? -> How does it feel? -> I empathize that you found joy doing this before. You will find joy in a new shared purpose. You will not be automated out of existence.

Automatable human work is worthy.

The best way to automate a profession is for the profession to age away without replacements - not to replace people currently working. Measure productivity improvements at the societal level. Ease the burden of current workers, don't replace them. If anything, automation means the people in that profession will start getting paid more and treated better - they're now experts and system-builders instead of low-level cogs in a human-powered machine.

Story of one product, and the same person or same family is automated at every step.
