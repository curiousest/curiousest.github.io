*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

4000BC, some village.
Village girl, 13yo, bleeds.

I looked down and... blood. Not coming from a normal place. Not my hand, my arm, or my leg. Between her legs.

She can just imagine her father yelling at her, "that's not normal!"

"The last time I was sick, my parents made me sleep outside for a month, so I didn't get my working brothers sick too. I won't let that happen again."

In some setting, sees other woman 23yo.

"Hey, you're bleeding down there."

"Oh damn, I have been feeling terrible. Thanks, I didn't catch that."

"It's happening to me too. Do we have the same disease?"

*Laughs* "Disease? Oh, I think so, yes. What a plight! Funny girl."

"Is there a cure?"

*Laughs harder* "The love of a man. It is just a temporary relief - as fleeting and double-edged as his love."

"Oh. My father won't like that at all. And your husband - does he not love you anymore?"

*Dying laughing*

"Will it make me hysterical like you are now? And I want to love a woman. Will it make me fall in love with a man too? Oh, this is bad."

Young girls gets visibly agitated.

*Dying laughing, realizes this is a formative experience for the girl and deserves more tact, composes herself.*

"Aw, pet, I'm only teasing you. I thought you knew. This is completely normal. It's not a disease, it's just part of becoming a woman. It's called your period. Every woman I know got it around your age. When you tell your parents, they'll be pleased. And yes, you must love a man. What a strange thought, to love a woman like a woman ought to love a man. You're funny."

*Thinks to herself, "well I hope it makes me think boys are attractive, because they seem horrible to me right now."

"Thank you." she blushes, and wanders off.

*50% of people are women. Being a woman is a normal way of being a human.*

Books become widespread by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

1950, somewhere in America.

Man of some ethnicity reads [The City and the Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Pillar). Friend yells at him for expressing his attraction ("it's not normal") Realizes he's gay and being gay is normal. Contemplates how he feels about his gender - that he thinks he has the wrong gender. Doesn't feel that's normal. Or: contemplates someone of another ethnicity that he's attracted to, but it's not normal.

*10% of people are homosexual. Being homosexual is a normal way of being a human.*

Television achieves X% household penetration in XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands. 1971, somewhere in America.
Grandmother or someone says, "dating that white boy is not safe and it's not normal". Black woman sees the [Star Trek interracial kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss) and realizes it's ok to be attracted to other races, and it's normal. Contemplaters how she feels about government policy on 
a drug of her heritage (marijuana). It's not tolerated, must not be normal. Or maybe mental health condition, anxiety or something else...

*In 2010, 15.1% of marriages in the US were between spouses of a different ethnicity from one-another. Interracial relationships are a normal way of being a human.*

X% of adults have a social media account by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2022, somewhere in America.

Relatable white dude has a condition relateable to any mid-west 25-50s white dude, but still rare (something mental health-related). He confides in someone and they say "I've never felt that so it's not normal". Sees something in social media. He realizes it's normal. He goes to social gatherings with others who are the same. Finds attraction to a woman. Contemplates how it's not tolerated to have a romantic relationship with someone who isn't your wife. Wishes that he could have multiple relationships, while still being committed to his wife, wonders why society doesn't work that way. It's not tolerated, must not be normal.

*In 2022, X% of men reported a mental health problem. Y% reported anxiety, Z% reported feelings of depression. A% reported having no intention of talking about it with anyone. These mental health "problems" are normal. They're part of being a normal human. You can work on them, with or without another person, so you can enjoy your existence even more.*

By 2100, every moment of a person's life is recorded. By 2200, everyone openly shares that information. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2300, somewhere in America

Technology that makes a person able to "walk in someone else's shoes". Woman sees old, famous, now dead, man in the media. Steps into his most famous experiences (this is how we teach people now). Explores his thoughts. Experiences something (multiple relationships related?) that she has also experienced, but hadn't figured out yet. (From perspective of Sarah first date in a bar) Three pillars of relationships: friendship, lust, and commitment. Also explore "a person's relationship with you changes over time. People are continuous and fluid over time, not discrete with relationships set-in-stone. Different people are appropriate for you at different phases of your life, and that's ok. It's normal." Curiousity is perfectly normal, the new thing she experiences is completely normal, and he proactively consented to anyone doing that (like most normal people of that future age). Perfect transparency. Incredible tolerance. She has a feeling of being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her. Deja-vu-esque, the thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. That's not normal, so she squashes the thought.

On the train. Halfway there. A message pops up from a new guy she's been dating, Aaron. "hey, I want to see you again. There's a cool place at XYZ I want to check out. Thursday, you interested?"

It sounds very interesting. But she has a problem. Where she's going now. To Victor's place. They're getting a bit more serious - in a "we see each other regularly and it's great" kind of way. They have an implicit commitment to meet regularly, but exclusivity is still up in the air. And she knows she wants to have romantic relationships with both Victor and Aaron. What to do?

She remembers an old digitized memory one of her girlfriends had been raving about. She decides to take a look and steps into the memory.

It's a dark bar. Maybe a nightclub, the kind you sit in to talk. From the look of her hands and dress, she's probably a woman. There's a handsome man across from her, so she's probably a pretty one. He's confidently gesticulating.

"So you have multiple partners? And you have a primary partner. What are you looking for from those other girls? Sex?"

"Sex is one of the things, of course. But I'm looking for other things - to learn from and grow with the people I date. See, the way I think about relationships is... There are these three sliding scales of any loving relationship, three dimensions of love: friendship, commitment, and lust. Friendship love - you have that for your family, for your friends, for your partner. Or you might not. Commitment - you might have that for your family or a partner you've signed a contract with. Maybe it's a social contract like civil partnership or children, maybe it's a financial contract like a house mortgage or marriage. Finally lust - you have that for romantic partners. All three of these scales are sliding. Each person you have a close relationship fits into different places on these scales. You might have some expectations of where you want to land with a new person, but you have to navigate that relationship to see what you'll be to each other."

"That makes sense. I've always thought, I probably won't have just one husband. People grow different directions over time, and they eventually stop being the right person for one-another."

"Wow, that's mature of you to say. Yeah, relationships change over time, and where people fall on that spectrum changes over time. And that's ok. I always find it interesting, how different women I date end up wanting different things from me, as our relationship becomes clearer over time."

They catch each others' gaze. Pause conversation, it moves on. The memory dissipates.

She's back on the train. Victor and Aaron. This is good. She can work with this. She knows what she wants, and realizes it's a normal want. Of course she wants to love many people - who doesn't? It's completely normal. She's grateful for the new perspective.

In the same thought, she has a feeling almost like deja vu. The thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. It's almost like being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her right here and now. That's not normal. She squashes the thought.
