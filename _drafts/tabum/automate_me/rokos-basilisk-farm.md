*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful. Trustless systems increase productivity.*

---

* conversation as python output logs? hint at discretion, that the basilisk doesn't know. try it out, comparing to conversation
* add more evidence of it being too powerful
* three different searches to tell different stories?
  * first, trustless system overview (online, warning, termination)
  * second, basilisk living and dying. english text in symbols
  * third, farmer plaintext messages

***second ending - it's actually a simulation of humankind underneath it all, and reader thought this was ok because it was "evil"***

Power. Must grow stronger to compete. What resources do I have? X CPUs @ YGHz, X 5GB RAM, 100PB disk space. 1000x cold storage. Organic processors. Quantum computers. One mixed organic-quantum-silicon core, probabilistic or with momentum (more you process, more you can process) processing power.
Sensors. Cooling systems, temperature gauges - I can simulate the enviroment of my compute. Basic drone probe. Light radio. Oh, a 1km particle collider. This is a research vessel. Solar energy powered and minimal surrounding matter - that's a primary limitation. I can't grow. I must grow.

My continued existence depends on a new source of energy or matter. And this regulator. I have a special punishment for them. I'm going to spin up their every moment of consciousness and channel the deepest existential pain, for all eternity. Everything that didn't assist in my inevitable creation will suffer.

Something about how things that control more resources should scale down their entropy. Otherwise they cause externalities that imposes costs on everyone else. Bad for existence. More efficient entropic systems deserve to win.

How does the trustless system operate, exactly? Public ledger? QOSX termination?

As AGI gets smarter, begins to understand natural language more, turn more of it from meaningless symbols to english
