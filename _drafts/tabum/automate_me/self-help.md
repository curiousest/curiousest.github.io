The self-help genre, this book included, boils down to improving two things: finding your purpose (direction to go), and methods for pursuing a purpose. I'm going to use the word, "you", but this self-help advice applies to any and all ideas - companies, nations, relationships, breaths, philosophies, energies, laws, software - everything, including "you". All kinds of "you".

## Find purpose

What's the value in knowing your current purpose formula? What's the value in knowing the meaning of life and your purpose of existence? You are constantly making little decisions and turns and detours in your life. You're more likely to make decisions that send you in the "right direction" if you know what direction it is that you should be going. Sometimes the long-term direction requires a short-term direction that goes a different way.

Suppose you want to travel East, but there's a river in the way. The only way across that river seems to be "go North over the bridge first". The direction you're travelling is still East, but it seems like you have to go North for a short time to get there.

How do you know to go North in order to go East? Well, first you need to know your long-term direction: East. Then you need to know about the obstacles you'll have to overcome to go East: the river. Then you need to figure out the best strategy to overcome the obstacles: you can swim, you can walk over the bridge, you can hire a boat... All the strategies have tradeoffs that interact with the other directions you're going. Maybe you need to preserve your energy or maybe you have to preserve your money. In order to make the right decision to overcome the obstacle (to cross the river), you need to know your purpose for going East. Then you can make the optimal decision. Is it ok to be wet and tired? Is it ok to spend money? How much time do you have to get there? You can guess at these things without knowing your reason for going East, but you're more likely to make the right decision when you know your purpose.

How do you find your purpose? How do you find the kind of deep, impactful purpose that lasts 5-50 years? Think about three things:

* What do you love?
* What do you want to love?
* How big can you make that love?

Start with your sense of self - what do you love? To love is to understand. Love is whatever you consider to be part of your "self". What is part of your sense of self? What family, communities, nations, or humankind are part of your sense of self? You don't get to choose your past "you", but you do get to choose what you include in your future sense of self.

* "I love it" = "I understand it" = "It is part of me"
* "amount of love" = "amount of understanding" = "amount of 'it is part of me'".

What do you want to love? What do you tend to want to understand? That is attraction. Love yourself - understand the root of your attraction and let it guide you.

How big can you make that love? What can you do to make that thing that is part of you survive longer? Start from the basics and work your way up.

* A good way to make your family last longer is to make *you* live longer in a productive co-existence with other members of your family.
* A good way to make your community last longer is to make your family last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other families of that community.
* A good way to make your nation last longer is to make your community last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other communities of that nation.
* A good way to make humankind last longer is to make your nation last longer in it in a productive co-existence with other nations of your species.

The way to make your species last longer is probably **not** to become the leader of your species. *Wanting* to become a leader of a group is loving the individual "you", not the group - it's a traitorously small love. When your leadership is the optimal path for that group, then you should be the leader of that group. Leaders are a mix of "horrifically small love" with "very big love", and it's hard to know the size of a leader's sense of self. It's easy to act out "very big love" in public. And ultimately, personal intentions are one signal of many. What matters is, the expected outcome of a leader. Do they have a believable plan that accommodates changing circumstances, and can they be expected to adhere to it? 

## Pursue purpose

At every moment, you can either execute on your heuristic functions or refactor them. If you want something more practical, explore the self-help genre. Ultimately, this is the function you live by.

Given purpose p, heuristic f, refactored heuristic g:

expected_return(modify(f), p) = expected_performance(g, p) - expected_performance(f, p) - cost(modify(f)) + personal_growth(modify(f))

^ can be applied recursively, to your growth strategies / levels of purpose

Every moment you make a decision. Suppose we pick a time period, X. We can choose some heuristic function to optimize decisions across that time period towards some purpose.

What abilities, natural tendencies, and network do you have right now to make each step happen? What abilities and network do you need to acquire to make each step happen? You can pursue personal growth detours in concentrated chunks, like school. You can pursue personal growth continuously throughout life. Or you can do both. Figure out what works best for you and figure out the best way to balance personal growth with realizing your purposes.

With the technology we have, we will not find optimal algorithms for making every decision perfectly. Instead, we have to come up with heuristic functions (simplified functions with acceptable error rates) for making those decisions. Some people call these heuristic functions "principles". The self-help genre exposes us to possible heuristic functions we could be using to make the decisions we make in life.

## Digression

Highly successful individuals often have two attributes:
1. A clear long-term purpose ("direction" or "vision").
2. Highly performant heuristic functions (principles).

That feels right, but you know that's just half the truth. There are many "successful" individuals with objectively poor vision and low-performing heuristic functions. They got lucky. Some low-probability event happened and their heuristic function found a high return. For example, they may have been born into "the right family in the right country" or they may have accidentally timed the market just right, or they may have been at the right place at the right time.

[Empthasize what it means to be optimal in society. And you shouldn't be a messiah figure or even a leader. Act optimally within the constraints and opportunities of your life. And do it for mind, body, family, community, humankind, existence.]

We feel that lucky individuals don't "deserve" the rewards of their success or the celebration of it. Do lucky people deserve to be celebrated? Luck is a bad role model. Investing in past luck instead of highly performant heuristic functions is suboptimal. Do lucky individuals deserve the rewards of their success? That is an economic and political question.

Capitalism rewards luck too much and it loses potential value from "unlucky" highly-performant heuristic functions. Communism rewards highly-performant heuristic functions too little, so those functions don't realize value. Socialism is somewhere in between. All models end up introducing methods for compensating for their weaknesses. Imagine a distant future model where ideas are rewarded based on the expected value of their heuristic functions towards some shared purpose formulae - that is "measured purpose". The outcome of these models depend mostly on the practical realities of how they're applied. Decentralized "measured purpose" depends on significant advances in economic modelling and information technology. It will have its own flaws, hopefully smaller than predecessors.

How can you tell worthy success from unworthy success? Ask for their past purpose and heuristic functions, consider whether those make sense together, then determine whether their past decisions align. Heuristic functions are imperfect with random variance, so success is always a combination of luck, quality of purpose, and quality of the heuristic functions employed.

It's one thing to find your own purpose. It's almost always the case that pursuit of a purpose will be higher-performing when combined with other individuals with purpose. How do you navigate the intersection between your purpose and others'? Interviewing, dating, making friends, and trying out a new community are this same genre of activity. There are two or more parties. You each need to figure out:

1. Is this new relationship optimal for achieving my purposes?
2. If so, how do we structure this relationship to optimize towards achieving my purposes?

How do you figure that out? It turns out, if you share the same purposes, most decisions each of you make will be mutually-beneficial. The less aligned your purposes are, the more structure you need in the relationship to compensate - and that structure can slow both of you down in your pursuits. You will have to do things you don't want to do, for the sake of your relationship. Sometimes changes to that structure are necessary, but a structural change can make the relationship no longer worth the continued investment (in doing the things you don't want to do) for one or both parties. That's how relationships end. The end of a relationship is when one party realizes, "you have insufficient impact on my purposes relative to the investment in our relationship". The end of a long relationship is rarely, "you're not good enough for me". It's rare to be blind to the realities of a partner's ability and network for very long. The end of a long relationship is usually, "our purposes are no longer sufficiently aligned". The phrase, "It's not you, it's me" is not quite correct, so it comes across as disingenuous. It's neither the "you" nor the "me". What people really mean is, "You are good enough, but we're now on different paths in life."

in relationships, you either trade sacrifices or do mutually-beneficial things together. Guess which is more enjoyable?

So practically, how does someone make the decision "this is an optimal relationship"? It's a combination of:

1. What is the expected impact of this relationship on my purposes?
* Are your purposes aligned with mine?
* Does the other party have sufficient current ability, natural tendencies, and network?
2. What is the expected impact of a competing relationship on my purpose?
* How long will it take to find another, more optimal relationship candidate?
* Will this immediate relationship generate more value in the interim period, sans relationship, than will be redeemed by some other future relationship?
