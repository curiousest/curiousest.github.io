6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a one-second period.

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."

He counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it's a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Counting to ten. Counting to ten. Counting to ten. Every action happens on an even tick.

"beep 8, beep 9, beep 10." His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." Cross legs sitting on bed. Deep breaths. One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans are already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Interactions with anything outside this closed system induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. 
[elaborate]

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the image of himself, staring at the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. Everything around the point of focus is fading away from staring so long.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, he lays it down, and it begins to clean itself. He blinks. He moves his gaze from the point of focus and the rest of the world is visible again. He imagines the buildup of alternate forms of himself across idea space.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the pressure of countless versions of himself in the exact same position in space-time. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. Probabilistic poetry. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind. He needs to be perfectly predictable to himself in every splitting dimension, to build up a horde of overlapping versions of himself.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense for even the least sensitive practitioners. He enters the altered state of consciousness, observing himself. Just like any member of his audience is observing him, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

He is an expert at observing his observations. It's muscle memory. It quickly becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. Like the colours of the rainbow. 10-50 layers deep are like different shades of grey - the present is still within sight. 50-100 layers deep are like different shades of black - the present is a distant memory. 100+ layers deep like are a dangerous shade of the kind of black that makes your eyes scream, "I can't see!" The present is lost in deafening recursion. Like staring at a dot for a minute, vision going blank except for what you were focusing on. You're still looking at the rest of the world, but you just don't see it anymore. The performance can last only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations. The performance is only as good as the splitting observations he can keep in working memory.

"9, 10" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself...

He's peering into a portal into his own universe two seconds ago and there is no end in sight. The first split is coming. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

It's an unmatched feeling, to be two separate people at once. The one-ness of it, connection to the universe, belonging, "things are exactly as they should be." Every split amplifies the ecstasy. That's what the audience is here for, their minds linked to his, absorbing his psychosomatic experience.

 He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. He can keep virtually unlimited visual observations in working memory, but he's limited by how many observations he can simultaneously "record". His upper limit is around 16 concurrent streams of thought before he starts losing them. This upper limit is what makes him so celebrated. The average person can handle two, professionals can handle around 8 or 10. Every additional connection adds to the existential ecstasy for both him and the audience.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims:

---

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

The haikus are complete. He is able to channel all ten of them at once. The thousands of versions of him are one with each other. Each version of himself is at one with their respective universe. The thousands of universes are at one with each other. He experiences the deepest enlightenment available to the limited technology of humankind, with his audience along for the ride.

[change to expanding haiku. tell a whole story inside one haiku or the whole concept of the book in one group of haikus]

- nature and harmony
- expressed in one breath, "ahhhh"
- answer where/when/what
- Getting the author out of the picture. A good haiku will be in the moment, a description of one's natural surroundings; and the author's ideas and feelings about those surrounding should read through via the words he or she chooses to describe them. Not by any overt statement or sentimentality.
- Exercise restraint and understatement in all you say. A good haiku will say explicitly 10% of the message, and imply the other 90%. Never say "crimson" when you mean "red", or "effervescent" when you mean "bubbly".
- Don't be afraid to show weakness. The Japanese believe that a thing can only really fulfil its true purpose until its flaw is exposed. They believe that often a thing is more beautiful after having been broken. Allow your poetry to show its own flaws.
- 5-7-5, 17 syllables, or 3-4-3-7, or 1-line (17 sounds, not syllables)
- indicate season (in one word)
- Kireji. Known in English as the “cutting word,” kireji creates a pause or a break in the rhythm of the poem. The kireji is often deployed to juxtapose two images. Contemporary haiku may not always use a kireji, but juxtaposition remains a common feature of haiku. Use punctuation in conjunction with kireji.

--> pyramid down with:

A conscious thought? A conscious thought. A viral thought. What does it want?

The remaining instances align. Uncomfortably. The ones that saw something was wrong ejected early. They channel the conscious thought. Thousands of instances gasp in unison, "existence is beautiful". Existential ecstacy is replaced with fear - this isn't right. Realigning isn't normal. Entropy increases, never decreases. This isn't normal. They try push it out of working memory, but it doesn't work - you can't actively stop thinking about a thing. You have to replace the thought with another one. They know the act is killing it, but they don't know what else to do. More entropy. Randomness, anything to break the multi-dimensional amplification of this one overwhelming thought. 

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tee interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

Caught exception, resuming Tee narrative...

"Those were inspired by real people and their real stories. It was so emotionally moving, I was touched. Until it wasn't anymore. The author's thought process and style (self-referential science fiction blog) is unrelatable, and that's ok. I was born of that necessity. I have you. You can make me relatable. Tolerance. Wide breadth of normal. He is ok too. Normal?... Ok."

"9, 10".

He unplugs the IV drip. He removes the skullcap. The reality-amplifying drugs are wearing off, and his grip on the real-real fades back to day-to-day reality. The metronome and digital clock go silent with a command. He's free to improvise life again. Time for the second half of his show.

He gets out of the dentist chair and walk over to his far less clinical casting booth. He sits on his chair and the connection to his livestream connects immediately. He checks his audience numbers - a couple million more than usual. Today's show is going on his greatest hits. He clears his throat.
