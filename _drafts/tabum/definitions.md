Purpose: a set of objectives that ideas can optimize their decisions towards.

Purpose formula: the formula an idea uses to make all decisions, that intends to optimize towards a set of conditionally-prioritized purposes.

Religion: the ecosystem of principles, behaviours, and culture that result from optimizing towards a purpose.

Love: the assertion, "self exists"

To love: to believe something is part of "sense of self". All the things you consider to be part of "yourself", you understand.

Two or more ideas are "in love": two or more ideas each include the other(s) in their "sense of self". Their purposes and purpose formulae are aligned.

Self: an idea that consistently exists across all dimensions which you have agency over at every point it exists across the dimension of time.

Consciousness: the feeling that an idea pattern gets at a particular moment in time to identify "self".

Idea: could exist, across all planes of existence.
(in Platonic thought) an eternally existing pattern of which individual things in any class are imperfect copies.
(in Kantian thought) a concept of pure reason, not empirically based in experience.

To understand: to determine an accurate purpose heuristic decision algorithm. 

Beautiful: to be a complex system operating as understood.

Exciting: an unexpected quality, that there's a chance to experience beauty. A chance for a surprising understanding.

Spiritualism: to be spiritual is to find pleasure in observing a complex systems that are not understood.

Enlightenment: newly understanding a complex system was not understood before. 

Profound: an understood idea that fits consistently into a complex, poorly understood system, in such a way that the poorly understood idea might be understood with the simple idea as one of the building blocks.

Worthy: optimal. Of a high-performing purpose formula.

Pleasure: a signal that is triggered by a less-likely, important-for-survival behaviour, that indicates more of that behaviour should happen.

Joy: a signal that indicates survival conditions are being met.

Fear: a signal that indicates some conditions of survival may soon be broken.

Sadness: a signal that indicates a part of self was destroyed.

Anger: a signal that indicates present conditions may necessitate unusually destructive behaviour to maintain survival conditions.

Interest: a signal that indicates there are possible future conditions which will increase chances of survival and you can increase the chances of those future conditions.

Self-Hostility: a signal that indicates survival is more likely if some part of self is destroyed.

Surprise: a signal that indicates an immediate bout of processing will increase chances of survival. 

Disgust: a signal that indicates an observed behaviour reduces the longer-term chances of survival of a smaller sense of self.

Shame: a signal that indicates an observed behaviour reduces the longer-term chances of survival of a greater sense of self.

Contempt: a signal that something which attracts attention is a waste of time - time that could be used on other survival activities.

Shyness: a signal that a decision may lead to a reduction in the longer-term chances of survival.

Guilt: a signal that a past decision of a smaller part of self may have decreased the survival of a greater part of self.
