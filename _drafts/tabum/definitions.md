Purpose: a set of objectives that ideas can optimize their decisions towards.

Purpose formula: the formula an idea uses to make all decisions, that intends to optimize towards a set of conditionally-prioritized purposes.

Religion: the ecosystem of principles, behaviours, and culture that result from optimizing towards a purpose.

To love: To understand. Whatever you consider to be part of your "self". All the things you consider to be part of "yourself", you understand. All the things you understand, you consider to be "part of yourself".

Two or more ideas are "in love": two or more ideas each include the other(s) in their "sense of self". Their purposes and purpose formulae are aligned.

Self: an idea that consistently exists across all dimensions which you have agency over at every point it exists across the dimension of time.

Consciousness: the feeling that an idea pattern gets at a particular moment in time to identify "self".

Idea: could exist, across all planes of existence.
(in Platonic thought) an eternally existing pattern of which individual things in any class are imperfect copies.
(in Kantian thought) a concept of pure reason, not empirically based in experience.

To understand: to determine an accurate purpose heuristic decision algorithm. 

Beautiful: to be a complex system operating as understood.

Exciting: an unexpected quality, that there's a chance to experience beauty. A chance for a surprising understanding.

Spiritualism: to be spiritual is to find pleasure in observing a complex systems that are not understood.

Enlightenment: newly understanding a complex system was not understood before. 

Profound: an understood idea that fits consistently into a complex, poorly understood system, in such a way that the poorly understood idea might be understood with the simple idea as one of the building blocks.

Worthy: optimal. Of a high-performing purpose formula.
