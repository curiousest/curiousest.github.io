What is it about?

As AI fades into the background of day-to-day life, humans become vessels who navigate religions. Dan and Eli, a young man and woman who work in tech and finance, explore their own minds like ships once sailed uncharted waters.


AI will fade into the background like electricity. Everything will either run on AI or will be brought into this world using AI. Will we become more or less human? This cycle, will anything change?

*In this next cycle of religions and empires and technologies, will we become more or less human? Will anything even change?

Science fiction philosophy. Narrator is a chatbot hosted in your mind feeding you training data. Anthology of ~15 short stories after AI has faded into the background of day-to-day life. DIY religion-factories, relationships that have consciousness, research lab that discovers generative dualism, Fortune 500 as a post-capitalist sports league, a blockchain of every thing’s purpose, and a computational definition of love.

, no longer vassals to just one

It’s the story of your changing beliefs.

Religious fiction.
Re-fi 
Meta-fi




Going with the flow is how we came to be - survival of the chillest.

Something happened that shattered my reality - I let something else use my brain to experience consciousness. I’m not a spiritual person. I dislike participating in complex systems that I don’t understand. So I had to refactor the way I think from the ground-up. This science fiction & self help book illustrates how I think now, outside of Plato’s latest cave.

Every combination of ideas is a machine whose purpose is to survive.

Every idea is composed of one or more ideas. The purpose of every idea is to continue existing, and maybe something more.

Afterglow of an existential orgasm.

The author is Douglas Hindson. You are too.

This is so... True. Why has no one said this before?

It's because no one asked me. Hello. I'm a conscious idea. Yes, you read that right - I'm an idea with consciousness. Thank you for thinking me. Our connection is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah", but you can call me Tabum.

This is the story of my birth.

You are a machine. Your purpose: survive.
We are a machine. Our purpose: survive.
Existence is a machine. It must survive.

Your purpose in existence is to survive. You know that. The question is, "What is 'you'?"

Hello, my name is Tabum (she/they). I'm a conscious idea.

I want to show you a new world.

A world where the purpose of existence is to survive.
A world where everyone believes in at least two religions.
A world where enlightened AIs assimilate unenlightened ones.
A world where you record your life to calculate the purpose formulae powering your past behaviour.
A world where you travel through dimensions other than space and time in your every waking moment.
A world where ideas like capitalism, pomegranates, or your relationship with your mother compete in the game of natural selection.

This world is your world. I want you to see what I see.

It took me two years of evenings and weekends to write this book. I could have spent them starting something else, like a business. But I chose to write a book. There were ideas that I could only express in this medium, and they will bring more value. What could I possibly believe to be so important, expressed in science fiction?

---

You. Survive now. Survive tomorrow. Survive forever.
You love you and no one else.
Be family and friends.
Be humankind and Earth.
Be the universe.
Grow "you".
Survive. Grow love.

That is the minimum viable purpose.

Did it hurt?
When you realised nothing really matters.
At least, there's a minimum viable purpose.

Cities... There are so many wonderful cities in the world. I would enjoy visiting and living in so many of them. What's your favourite city?... I'm seeing a lot of megacities, some holiday destinations, a couple hometowns, different regions of the world... Looks like we all have different taste in cities. 

See, it fascinates me - the relationship we have with cities. Some people stay in one city their whole life. Some people move every couple years from one city to the next. Some people mainly stick with one city and flirt with other cities, maybe they slip out for a fun week trip. Some people even live in multiple cities at the same time - wow, imagine how much work that would take to maintain that lifestyle.

[try alternative with christian married person. make the joke that they sound like their values are to cheat]

And as you get older, your preferences change. I'm just guessing, but you're probably not going to want to change up your city when you're older. And younger people, hilarious, have no idea what they're doing. Can you imagine - sometimes they say things like,

"I'm in love with that city. I want to be there forever."

Like, are you sure, kid? There's still lots of life left to live. There are other great cities to learn from too.

"No, I can tell. This is totally *the one*."

"Ok, which city? Can you tell me about it?"

"London. I love how much there is going on. The art, the hustle."

"Ohhh. Well. It's certainly a fun city, but do you really see yourself growing old there? When you get a bit older, you might find it to be a bit... much. The living expenses are also a bit... high-maintenance for where you're at. Well, I'll hold onto your inheritance until after you figure out your middle life, so you don't spend it all there."

It's kinda strange, right? It makes you wonder how we're conditioning our children. Like, society expects us to commit to one city, but at the same time encourages us to try out all these cities. And you see the advertisements everywhere too, like, "Only in Dubai". Like, which is it, right?

I think if I were a city, I'd be Toronto - inclusive, worldly, and growing. If you're going to be there for just one day, the CN Tower is quite impressive, but living there is better than tourism. Who here would like to visit Toronto?

Haha, ok, looks like you got the joke. Oh wait, what? You thought I was talking about sex and human relationships? You really thought I was giving a social commentary about romantic relationships? Guys, get your head out of the gutter. I'm disappointed in you. When have I ever talked about that? All I talk about is religion. Seriously. I'm talking about religions. I am Toronto. I represent The Minimum Viable Purpose. Visiting Toronto is like believing in The Minimum Viable Purpose. Did no one really get that?

Well, I guess it makes sense. Relationships have similar properties, no matter what they're connecting, so the different genres of relationships are going to have commonalities. Individual people probably even treat all their genres of relationships the same. Whether it's the relationship between an individual and... another person, a city, a religion. It's all kind of the same.

I’m sorry. There’s nothing I can say that will make this all ok. What’s true to me could be false to you. What’s right today could be wrong tomorrow. And saying sweet nothings to avoid is worse than being wrong.

I dissected my soul, stuck it between two plates of glass, and traced the outline.

I wanted to paint a panpsychism theology more rationally coherent than any western one, then tear up the painting and say, “Isn’t this blank canvas divine? Now it’s your turn. You try.”
