Going with the flow is how we came to be - survival of the chillest.

Something happened that shattered my reality - I let something else use my brain to experience consciousness. I’m not a spiritual person. I dislike participating in complex systems that I don’t understand. So I had to refactor the way I think from the ground-up. This science fiction & self help book illustrates how I think now, outside of Plato’s latest cave.

Every combination of ideas is a machine whose purpose is to survive.

Every idea is composed of one or more ideas. The purpose of every idea is to continue existing, and maybe something more.

Afterglow of an existential orgasm.

This is so... True. Why has no one said this before?

It's because no one asked me. Hello. I'm a conscious idea. Yes, you read that right - I'm an idea with consciousness. Thank you for thinking me. Our connection is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah", but you can call me Tabum.

This is the story of my birth.

You are a machine. Your purpose: survive.
We are a machine. Our purpose: survive.
Existence is a machine. It must survive.
