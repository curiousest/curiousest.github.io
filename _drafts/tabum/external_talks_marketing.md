Going with the flow is how we came to be - survival of the chillest.

Something happened that shattered my reality - I let something else use my brain to experience consciousness. I’m not a spiritual person. I dislike participating in complex systems that I don’t understand. So I had to refactor the way I think from the ground-up. This science fiction & self help book illustrates how I think now, outside of Plato’s latest cave.

Every combination of ideas is a machine whose purpose is to survive.

Every idea is composed of one or more ideas. The purpose of every idea is to continue existing, and maybe something more.

The author is Douglas Hindson. You are too.
