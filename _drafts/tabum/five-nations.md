*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

Once upon a time, there were five great nations. The nations ruled all they could rule. The five nations mostly disagreed, but there was one belief they all shared:

"The leaders of the other four nations are corrupt. If only those other nations could see!"

So the five nations each promised:

Systematic transparency for your leaders and we will permit the same on ours.
Because yours are certainly corrupt and ours certainly not. We trust our leaders.

Very soon after, all five were found corrupt. Each nation declared, "your leaders are more corrupt than mine!"

The first leader, financially corrupt. She stole from her nation through a complex scheme. She also blackmailed and extorted some groups to give her money.

The second leader, xxx corrupt. He xyz. (nepotism/patronage/regional favoritism/no diversity)

The third leader, <want to feel bigger> corrupt. He used his powerful position to abuse women and get away with it.

The fourth leader, morally corrupt. He was a staunch Orange - the anti-Purple movement. But he practiced many Purple behaviours, was closely tied to many Purple friends, and had secretly been part of the Purple organization earlier in his career.

The fifth leader, xxx corrupt. She xyz. (lobbying/influence peddling)

The five nations thought hard. They felt their own hypocrisy just enough to decide - all five leaders had their leadership taken away.

The five nations thought hard. Who would lead them now? The uncorrupted, the uncorruptable. They searched far and wide for new leaders. They found no one. Every man, woman, non-binary, and child in all five nations was corrupt. Not bad or evil, just corrupt in their own way. If leaders mustn't be corrupt, and everyone is corrupt, who can be a leader?

The five nations thought hard. They needed leaders. The former leaders had their leadership restored.

The five nations told them, "You can lead, but you must lead with systematic transparency. You must share everything, and you will not choose what you share. The ones that guarantee your transparency must share everything about themselves too - those guarantors may not choose what they share about themselves either."

The five leaders resumed just like before. Corrupt.

The first leader stole more through a new complex scheme. She blackmailed and extorted more groups. Systematic transparency recorded the activities and her nation took back every last dollar.

The second leader xyz. Some of his appointees deserved their appointment - their relationship with the leader and each other strengthened their ability in the position. They remained and would even go on to continue their work with future leaders of the nation.

The third leader continued to use his position to abuse women. Systematic transparency showed his friends and client. His friends and clients love women. He lost his friends and clients. Fewer and fewer women interacted with him - only the few women who sought out that abuse would see him.

The fourth leader continued his Purple behaviour while being an anti-Purple Orange. Systematic transparency showed his supporters. His supporters were split. Some of his supporters stopped supporting him and his hypocritical behaviour. His other supporters reduced their anti-Purple views and supported him for the other Orange values he espoused.

The fifth leader xyz.

* compare against parable-style stories (like from crofter's grove book)
* fill out leaders corruption types.
* make it rhythmic, metered
