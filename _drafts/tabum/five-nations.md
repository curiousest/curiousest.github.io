*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

Once upon a time, there were five great nations. The nations ruled all they could rule. The five nations mostly disagreed, but there was one belief they all shared:

"The leaders of the other four nations are corrupt. It's ruining the world for us. If only those other nations could see!"

So the five nations each promised:

Systematic transparency for your leaders and we will permit the same on ours.
Because yours are certainly corrupt and ours certainly not. We trust our leaders.

Very soon after, all five were found corrupt. Each nation declared, "your leaders are more corrupt than mine!"

The first leader, corrupt. He was supposed to be one of the Orange (the anti-Purple movement). While everything he said was Orange, everything he did was Purple.

The second leader, corrupt. He used his powerful position to abuse women and get away with it.

The third leader, corrupt. He replaced all the leaders in his nation with his minority in-group.

The fourth leader, corrupt. She stole from her nation through a complex graft and extortion scheme.

The fifth leader, corrupt. She used her power to benefit the organizations that put her in power - organizations run by other nations.

The five nations thought hard. They felt their own hypocrisy just enough to decide - all five leaders had their leadership taken away.

The five nations thought hard. Who would lead them now? The uncorrupted! The uncorruptable! They searched far and wide for new leaders. They found no one. Every man, woman, non-binary, and child in all five nations was corrupt. Not bad or evil, just corrupt in their own way. If leaders mustn't be corrupt, and everyone is corrupt, who can be a leader?

The five nations thought hard. They needed leaders. The former leaders had their leadership restored.

The five nations created "The International Agency for Systematic Transparency". The agency guaranteed systematic transparency of the leaders of the five nations. The agents of the organization had to guarantee systematic transparency for themselves too.

1. All digital and analog communications to and from each member was recorded. No exceptions.
2. In-person interactions were recorded. No exceptions.
3. Past history was audited and recorded. No exceptions.
4. All their assets monitored and recorded. No exceptions.
5. All this data was made publicly available continuously, easy to search through, and free to use. No exceptions.

(try to incorporate into below stories)

These rules didn't apply to the common people, just those in power and the agents watching them. It was inefficient and invasive at first, but they built information technologies to adapt. Each competing nation invested in analysing the data, to find every corruption of the other powerful leaders.

The five leaders resumed just like before. Corrupt.

The first leader continued his Purple behaviour while pretending to be an anti-Purple Orange. He didn't even try to hide his behaviour. His supporters read his communications with Purples, saw his Purple writings, actions, and decisions. His supporters were split. Some of his supporters stopped supporting him and his hypocritical behaviour. His other supporters came to terms with his behaviour - that being Orange doesn't have to be anti-Purple. Those supporters reduced their anti-Purple views and supported him for the more worthy Orange values he espoused.

The second leader avoided abusing women for a while. But at a difficult time, he once again used his position to abuse women. Those interactions were recorded. He tried to delete the recordings, but that only drew attention to them. His friends and client saw him abusing women. His friends and clients loved women. He lost his friends and clients. Fewer and fewer women interacted with him - only the few women who sought out that abuse would see him.

The third leader led admirably in the present, but his leadership was doomed by his incompetent colleagues - the ones he appointed. They did not represent all his people - only a portion of them. His own people investigated the appointments and found the same pattern - all appointees had to belong to the same group because no diversity was tolerated in the selection process. Some of his appointees deserved their appointment and remained - their relationship with the leader and each other strengthened their ability in their positions. His people forced him to replace his incompetent appointments with people who represented other groups in the nation, making a more diverse group. The third leader's reign was conflict-ridden and uncomfortable, but later celebrated as the best the nation had ever had.

(rewrite)
The fourth leader stole more through a new complex scheme. She set it up before systematic transparency, and it wasn't caught in historical search. Only detectable through having all the data available and indexed to see patterns.
She blackmailed and extorted more groups. Systematic transparency recorded the activities and her nation took back every last dollar.

(rewrite) (caught manipulating the narrative)
The fifth leader tried to influence the agency for systematic transparency in every way possible. All of their communications out were logged. All the communications in to the agency were logged. One agency person deleted some things for a while (make fake data, delete data, augment data, stop collecting data), but a competing nation saw what they were doing and it got corrected. Messing with the behaviour of the agency was not tolerated. They were not allowed to participate in inter-nation society anymore. Their own nations put them in prison. 

The end.
