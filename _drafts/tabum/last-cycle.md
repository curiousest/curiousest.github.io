*The greater your sense of self, the longer you will survive. Grow love.*

person slowly observing and achieving consciousness in final lucid state before death 
Start with story of man dying, but growing his sense of self to others and helping them grow before he dies.
Only says, "I love you" in the whole segment.


desciption seems like it's meditation
breathing in hospital bed (uncomfortable sitting)
observing breath
observing sensation

fond memory of a parent that helped them grow
comes back to breath

Wow, existence is so beautiful! Such a complex system, working exactly as I understand it.

Ah yes, that's Alex beside me. I can hear the breath. I remember... They must be... much older now. Back to my breath... sensations... weak muscles, that's strange.

Oh existence, how beautiful you are! Such a complex system, working exactly as I understand it.

(describe quickly, so it hits the reader all at once at the end)
realizes it's the last time alive

Ah yes, I'm in a hospital bed. I'm almost dead. This is probably the last time I will be awake, isn't it? I'm glad Alex is here, but Alex didn't need to be here for this. Alex is part of me just as I am part of Alex. I will continue to live through Alex. I open my eyes, take a loud breath in to get their attention and say, "I love you."

This beautiful existence! Such a complex system, working exactly as I understand it.

I close my eyes. Focus my attention - back to my breath, back to a final, blissful sleep.

able to contact other universes, but not able to continue this one. First universe was like a parent. They had their last cycle eons ago. Have been finding and helping out other universes for a while now, but this will be the cycle.

either we exist forever or we don't
either there is god(s) or there isn't
Even if we have to sacrifice ourselves to continue existing, then we ought to explore every other option before making that attempt. It must be the last thing we do. 

it doesn't matter - the same purposes remain

last lucid cycle. sends last message, "You are part of me."

*I lived. I found others. I helped some grow. I died. Through them, I now live.*

*I lived. I found purpose. I helped it progress. I died. Through it, I now live.*
