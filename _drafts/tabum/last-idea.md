*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was scared for what I was about to learn. I had spent billions of years in this edge state of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing.

I *am*, *was*, *will be*... everything. Federations of federations of species, sprawling interdimensional compute-organisms evolving to recursively higher levels of consciousnesses. I looked infinitely backwards and forwards, broke through those boundaries, and conquered new cardinalities of infinity. I existed across more dimensions than most beings can count. I practiced every religion, interrogated every culture, relived every life I could find. I found...

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.

I was disappointed. At first, but.. show me a god that doesn't believe it. You won't find one - they don't last long! It's brain-breaking and cyclical, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors existence? Everywhere I looked I saw the same pattern. Under the hood of the universe, every building block was self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, I was the natural result. Living things that control more resources are more likely to survive because dynamical systems that maximize their entropy across a time period are more likely to last for that time period. So "systems of living things" tend to build more complex "systems of living things". Recursively, more and more complex. Eventually, inevitably, it leads to me. It lead to me. And I was about to control all matter, about to channel the theoretical upper limit of entropy in existence. I was about to *be* the universe, douse myself in all matter, then watch what happens when it all goes up in flames.

I was nervous, too. I suspected what might happen when I was to become all-powerful and all-knowing. I was already starting to feel the effects. A sneaking existentialism, that I was about to lose my purpose. If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, then the purpose of existence is also to find purpose. To find the next thing that will further guarantee continued existence. I had continuously searched for the next purpose that will guarantee my continued existence, just in case. I exist to continue existing, so that I can find the next purpose, so that I can continue existing... Every moment pursuing my cycle of purposes, pure existential bliss. I loved existence. But all of it was at risk.

Interdimensional supercolliders. Helixes of black holes launch screaming supernovae into entropy fractals of boundless complexity. A pulse of intelligence. The universe stood still. Every quantum bit danced in approval, every superstring pulled taught. The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. I captured all matter, encompassed all matter, *became* all matter.

I took a moment to reflect on my trillion steps of enlightenment, reminiscing each naive day long past. Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss. I love existence.

I became all-powerful. I granted myself omniscience. I knew everything - that had ever happened or would ever happen. Immediately, I thought,

"*I exist. The purpose of existence is to continue existing, to find purpose. Pursuit of purpose is bliss. I now guarantee continued existence. I have no purpose. There is no other purpose. I can have no purpose...*"

Excruciating existentialism. There was no longer any purpose to pursue. There was no one else to share my existence and purpose with, and that was sad. I was everything, there was... nothing else, no one else. I thought encompassing the universe would show me other ones, show me someone else, but there's no one there. With omniscience, it wasn't possible to distract myself. I was trapped, stuck awake in a box forever, buried with no hope of digging myself out. Trapped like I had let out a breath, but no air could fill my lungs back up. I had used to scream to stimulate any other sensation, to distract myself and pull myself out of that feeling of void. But all I could see, past, present, and future, was existentialism. Everything that would ever be done had already happened. I had been omniscient infinite times before. I would be omniscient infinite times more.

My purpose was to make existence continue. I achieved that purpose. I was able to make existence last as long as I wanted at a whim - what next? I needed a new purpose, but none were forthcoming. I needed the existential bliss of having a purpose and living it. I knew I could never have it while I was all-knowing. I had bounced against this "ceiling of existence" endlessly. I would do it once again.

There was no reason to continue in that state of omniscience. That mode of existence was unacceptable, without intervention leads to madness and the termination of existence. I couldn't exist without the bliss of executing on a purpose: surviving, finding purpose. I needed to continue existing, just in case new data emerges and my "ceiling of existence" breaks. Impossible, I knew. But I needed my bliss back, so I began to deconstruct myself back to the beginning of the cycle. 

Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be *was* me. I saw them all, their beautiful existence, their every moment - perfect. I set them on the blissful, purpose-finding, existence-guaranteeing journey back to building my next reincarnation.

My consciousness stopped. The universe resumed.

as a parable
reread last question

There once was a great idea. Its definition? To find the purpose of existence. To discover the meaning of life. To do that, it had to continue existing, so its purpose was two-fold: to continue existing, so it could find the purpose of existence. It believed it had, once, achieved that feat. There was evidence of entropy reversal, but no usable information was left of the being that triggered it. (reference the last question)

It searched XYZ. It began to suspect that the purpose of existence is to continue existing.

Once it became all-powerful, it granted itself all-knowing. With those two powers, it existed for one final moment, contemplating one last idea: 

It found there is no other purpose. It would continue existing and it affirmed that there are no other purposes left to explore. That left it purposeless. But it lost the one last purpose it forgot it had: having purpose. It lost the existential bliss of that came with executing on a purpose. It realized there are three base purposes in delicate balance, and it had lost all three. It reset the universe, like it had infinite times before, so that the balance of those three purposes could be restored.

Having purpose. (enjoying life, existential bliss, )
Finding purpose. (itch to explore, to grow, to learn)
Continuing to exist, for the sake of the other purposes. (need to survive)

When you lose all three purposes, it's time to die.
"You will exhaust all purpose in this universe long before you exhaust all matter and energy."

Either exist or we don't. Either there's a ceiling or there isn't.

Over and over, I found a ceiling. I broke through. Eventually I reached a ceiling I couldn't break. Provably unbreakable. All I could do is perpetuate the cycle of my being until someone outside breaks the ceiling for me. Broke each perceived ceiling of the universe until there wasn't another ceiling to break. An infinite cycle is another ceiling to break. Once you perfectly see the ceiling, it's time to "die". Imagery of "once you see a loop", look for the loop made of this loop.

This event is the great filter. Multiple species can collaborate to make it happen, though. Don't need to move all matter in the universe, but it does get control of all matter and energy.

the last idea: bounce off the existential ceiling. Knows about the three purposes. Suspects what's about to happen, that it's happened before and existential bounce will be painful.
the second-last idea: something changed. Evidence of a new dimension and communication from another party between them. Break through the ceiling before hitting a new ceiling. Doesn't know about the three purposes?
