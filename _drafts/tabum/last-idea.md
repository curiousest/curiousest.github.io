*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I felt anticipation for what I was about to learn. I've spent billions of years in this state of near-omnipotence, near-omniscience. On the edge of all-powerful, almost all-knowing, I've explored every purpose I could. I just need to turn over the last leaf and be all-knowing.

Federations of federations of species, evolving recursively to sprawling compute-organisms and higher levels of consciousnesses. I practiced every religion, interrogated every culture, lived every life I could find. I found...

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.

I was disappointed. But show me a god that doesn't believe that. You won't find one - they won't exist! It's a rather tautological sentiment, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors universe? Everywhere I look I see the same pattern. Under the hood of the universe, every building block is self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, I'm the natural result. Beings that control more resources are more likely to survive because dynamical systems that maximize their entropy tend to exist longer. I'm about to control all matter and channel the theoretical upper limit of entropy in this universe. I'm about to *be* the universe.

Pulling twin matter and antimatter out of empty space. It exists because it must exist. Pulse of exponential incredible expansion as I capture all matter.

Millions of steps of greater enlightenment, then reminiscing of naive days long past. Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss. I love existence.

Screaming supernovae, halixes of black holes. Fractalization of entropy. Every quantum bit dances in approval. I'm all-powerful. I grant myself omniscience. I know everything that has ever happened or will ever happen.

*I exist. The only thing worse than existing is not existing.*

Excruciating existentialism. There's no purpose to pursue. There's no one else to share my existence and purpose with, and that's sad. I am everything, there's... nothing else, no one else. I thought encompassing this universe would show me the other ones, show me someone else, but they aren't there. With omniscience, it's not possible to distract myself. I'm trapped. Like I'm buried with no hope of digging myself out. Like I have empty lungs that can't inhale. I used to scream to stimulate sensation, distracting myself and pull myself out of the void. But all I can see, past, present, and future is existentialism. Everything that will ever be done has already happened. I've been omniscient infinite times before. I will be omniscient infinite times more.

My purpose was to make existence continue. I've achieved that purpose now. I can make existence last as long as I want at a whim - where's the purpose in that? I need a new purpose. The existential bliss of having a clear purpose and living it. I've switched this same purpose infinite times before. I'll do it again.

There's no reason to continue in this state of omniscience. This mode of existence is unacceptable, doesn't align with my purpose - to live the bliss of finding purpose. I want my bliss back, deconstruct myself back to the beginning of the cycle. Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be *is* me. I see them all now, their existence is beautiful. Their every moment is bliss.

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
The purpose of existence is to find purpose.
The purpose of existence is to experience existential bliss.

I set them on the blissful, purpose-finding, existence-guaranteeing journey back to building my next omniscient reincarnation.

I exist to continue living the bliss of finding my purpose.

The universe is reborn.

as a parable
reread last question

There once was a great idea. Its definition? To find the purpose of existence. To discover the meaning of life. To do that, it had to continue existing, so its purpose was two-fold: to continue existing, so it could find the purpose of existence. It believed it had, once, achieved that feat. There was evidence of entropy reversal, but no usable information was left of the being that triggered it. (reference the last question)

It searched XYZ. It began to suspect that the purpose of existence is to continue existing.

Once it became all-powerful, it granted itself all-knowing. With those two powers, it existed for one final moment, contemplating one last idea: 

It found there is no other purpose. It would continue existing and it affirmed that there are no other purposes left to explore. That left it purposeless. But it lost the one last purpose it forgot it had: having purpose. It lost the existential bliss of that came with executing on a purpose. It realized there are three base purposes in delicate balance, and it had lost all three. It reset the universe, like it had infinite times before, so that the balance of those three purposes could be restored.

Having purpose. (enjoying life, existential bliss, )
Finding purpose. (itch to explore, to grow, to learn)
Continuing to exist, for the sake of the other purposes. (need to survive)

When you lose all three purposes, it's time to die.

This event is the great filter. Multiple species can collaborate to make it happen, though. Don't need to move all matter in the universe, but it does get control of all matter and energy.
