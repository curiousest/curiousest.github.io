*We are enlightened by the things we already believe, not new ideas.*

A young Lion boasted to a Donkey,
"Do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says me." boasted the young Lion.

"Ok." laughed the Donkey.

Years later, the same Lion came back and proclaimed to the Donkey,
"Now, do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says my might. Says my victories. Says science. Says God." growled the Lion.

"Ok." pleaded the Donkey.

Years later, the same Lion came back and preached to the Donkey,
"Now, do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says you. Because you are great too, and it's time for all to celebrate our greatness." chanted the Lion.

"Yes, I am great. You are great. Tell me more." said the Donkey.
