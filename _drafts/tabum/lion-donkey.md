*We already have the belief at heart, just not in words.*

A young Lion boasted to a Donkey,
"Do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says me." boasted the young Lion.

"Ok." laughed the Donkey.

Years later, the same Lion proclaimed to the Donkey,
"Now, do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says my might. Says my victories. Says science. Says God." growled the Lion.

"Ok." pleaded the Donkey.

Years later, the same Lion preached to the Donkey,
"Now, do you see how great I am?"

"Says who?" laughed the Donkey.

"Says you. Because you are great too, and the time for all to celebrate our greatness is due." chanted the Lion.

"I am great. You are great. Tell me more." said the Donkey.
