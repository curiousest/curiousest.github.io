Things emerge like, “Happy beings are more likely to want to continue existence. Love for other beings makes individuals prioritise the collective over itself sometimes. Happiness and love are good strategies for continued existence.”

In science, it lets you view every theory and behaviour through the lens, “how does this help the being(s) continue to exist and compete for resources in the game of natural selection?” It’s especially useful for social phenomena. Every behaviour has measurable utility.

Intelligence is a predictive measure of an individual’s utility towards its or its group’s continued existence. It’s relative. One individual’s impact on another’s continued existence.
Intelligence: expected potential impact on continued existence 
Emotional intelligence: ability to maximise impact, for a given potential, moment-to-moment, year-to-year, across lifetime.

With clear and consistent values, every decision becomes so much easier to compute. Every decision compounds a wave pointing in one direction.

I love existence. I want it to continue.

What would my toast want me to do? Suddenly my toast has consciousnesses. We often do it on behalf of other people. Behalf of child’s future version of self, on behalf of someone not in the room.

Can I make the stories have more consistent characters? More like Alice in wonderland. Breaking 4th wall necessary for conscious idea.
