*Measure purpose and make progress.*

So you're an enlightenment douche?

No. I mean maybe, but that's not what's wrong.

But what you're saying is firstly, you regularly experience significant changes in your purpose - enlightenment. And you tell everyone you can about that new purpose that they should share with you.

Second, your purpose formula, the equation that is unique to every person on the planet. The calculation that's always spinning away before our eyes. It's wrong for you and no one else, and it has been like that for five years?

Yes.

Dude, what's wrong with you? Look, my purpose numbers are dropping with every minute we're together. 

Purposes:

> everyone has balance of three MVPs. Then they have the lower-level purposes. Dude is 96% bliss, 3% continue existing, 1% find purpose

40% develop career
9th percentile of expected impact relative to world.
Month avg performance (current behaviour / potential impact):
86% 
5min avg performance (current behaviour / potential impact):
22%

20% personal validation
86th percentile of expected impact relative to world.
54% current behaviour / potential impact 
5% current behaviour / potential impact 

10% Tee (We exist to continue existence)
46% current behaviour / potential impact 
38th percentile of expected impact relative to world.

30% misc. assorted
39% current behaviour / potential impact
74th percentile of expected impact relative to world.

Look, even my house is suffering. Sofa:

80% make a comfortable environment for human productivity
46% current behaviour / potential impact

10% Tee (We exist to continue existence)
46% current behaviour / potential impact

10% misc. assorted
39% current behaviour / potential impact

Look, even my house is suffering. Flat:

50% make a comfortable environment for human productivity
46% current behaviour / potential impact

30% be a store of value
46% current behaviour / potential impact

10% Tee (We exist to continue existence)
46% current behaviour / potential impact

10% misc. assorted
39% current behaviour / potential impact


It doesn't work that way. You're an enlightenment douche.

Dude, just look at my purpose formula.

Purposes:

85% find a purpose greater than chasing the feeling of enlightenment
96% current behaviour / potential impact
3rd percentile of expected impact relative to world.

10% Tee (We exist to continue existence)
98% current behaviour / potential impact 
97th percentile of expected impact relative to world.

5% misc. assorted
97% current behaviour / potential impact
98th percentile of expected impact relative to world.

Those are the craziest numbers I've ever seen. Are you for real? No one is on top of their game across purposes. But you're bringing the world down with your purpose? Wow man, I feel sorry for you. I don't get it, though. What's wrong? Just change your purpose.

I can't. I'm stuck.

Not following. You get to choose your purpose. I'm guessing you already tried the basics. You know, that thing we're taught since we were five?

"If you want to change your purpose to be a good boy, think, *how would I behave if being a good boy was my purpose?* Do those things. Channel that thought basilisk. Eventually it will become part of your purpose formula."
(turn into rhyme)

Yeah that was my "year one" with this purpose. Years two to four was therapy. Year five was... You know, "regularly scheduled enlightenment with my fellow psychonauts". None of it worked. This is me, coming to you to try to change it. I experienced enlightenment each time, and truly believed my new purpose, is that not enough for the formula to change? Each new purpose isn't enough. Do I have to enlighten myself harder? I don't get it.

Do you want to know the list of enlightenments I've had? I write them down. I've had over one hundred cases, over one hundred purposes, but none of them showed up in my formula.

Oh, I keep track of Enlightenment magazine's annual "top twenty best purposes". I've done them all.

(insert rambling list of purposes)

Dude, you gotta stop trying so hard.

That was year three. I abstained for eight months. Not a single moment of inspiration. Now I'm here, talking to you, a Data Scientist with purpose formula expertise. You know how the formulae are constructed. I need to know what's wrong with mine. This is the highest potential I've ever had, so I think being here with you is promising.

Ok fine, I'll help you out. Let's look at your data... Dude, you've been at the top for this whole time except that one year of abstinence where you passed the 51st percentile.

Yeah, so?

That means there's probably only one other person out there like you. You're either top ten percentile or around 50th. No wonder your stats are so big. The formula's accuracy needs a ton of historical data to be accurate. Like millions of lifetimes. Your purpose is probably really rare. Of course the therapists can't talk about the one other person in the world like you. That's a data breach.

Dude I'm inspired. I have a new purpose. I gotta find this person.

Yeah, let me look at the demographics and location on the people with this purpose... We can probably pinpoint them. Oh dude, nevermind. It's like a top 50 most popular purpose, right below, "I believe in Kanye". Oh yeah, all the people like you have the same stats - low expected impact, high current behaviour / expected impact. That probably means a lot of people like you invent terrible purposes for yourself and get people to waste their energy on meaningless religions. You're really good at what you do though - getting enlightened. But I guess at the end of the day, you're just a slightly more meta enlightenment douche.

Have you tried producing art? You'd make a great artist.

Tried it. My stuff gets too preachy. Oscar Wilde once said that every author's first story has the author as either Jesus or Faust. In all my art, I'm both. Audiences found it... unrelatable.

Do you have a girlfriend?

I have some... followers...

Oh dude, this is too much. You're a professional cult leader. How many have you started? What's the top purpose you made?

Well, none of the purposes get attributed to me as being the first one to believe, because I'm stuck with this one. I started XYZ though, it went pretty big.

Yeah? Let me check it out... Oh, purpose popularity... It had three people.



I thought you've done this hundreds of times before. There's a void underneath all the other voids. It's a bit too much for me right now. Please talk to me about anything else. I don't want to think about it anymore.

Ends by seeing the pattern of how people escaped (meeting another person). Dude is like, "No one else is like me. They won't be able to relate to me." That purpose doesn't give me the same divine prophet enlightenment feeling. It's more like, friendly neighbour nodding at each other because we're all equals, just chilling, kinda feeling. Gross. My taste in purpose is much greater than that. Refuses the real enlightenment. It drops back down to 0. Goes to talk to a person like him. Jumps up high again. "I finally get it." But this void is deeper, going this direction will shake me to my core. There's a void there. Nah, I'm not pulling that scab off. Not happening. I'm not ready for that level of enlightenment.

Well, you know what to do when you're ready. We're not in a rush. You don't have any existential pressures, so let life move at your own pace. Find and help someone like you.

Instead of "I am the messiah" enlightenment, you experienced, "we're in this together" enlightenment. There are different kinds of enlightenment!? Whoa dudeeee. Stop channelling that kind. Get back on this shared enlightenment train to another purpose.

Menu of purposes, to design your own formula. Enlightenment is changing your formula. It's just another normal part of human life, like,
"hey, I got enlightened today. My formula changed."
"Oh nice, was it a big change? Short-term or long-term purpose?"
Analogy: enlightenment (your purpose radically changing) is a normal part of continuous mental development. A normal, but sometimes intense, part of life. Like the birth of your child or having a loved one die. The old you dies and there's a new you that you're not completely comfortable with yet. You're used to playing the old you - it's far more familiar, fresh new circuits that haven't been used much are under strain and old worn ones are dormant. The old thought basilisk that is you has died and a new one is here (new purpose / definition).  


At worst, our purposes don't change and we get it switched again next month. At first they're like, <3. But then they're like, "oh shit, I got you to think about something else. I won't be able to see my purpose for another year! What's my purpose now!?" Existential dread.

Things emerge like, “Happy beings are more likely to want to continue existence. Love for other beings makes individuals prioritise the collective over itself sometimes. Happiness and love are good strategies for continued existence.”

In science, it lets you view every theory and behaviour through the lens, “how does this help the being(s) continue to exist and compete for resources in the game of natural selection?” It’s especially useful for social phenomena. Every behaviour has measurable utility.

Intelligence is a predictive measure of an individual’s utility towards its or its group’s continued existence. It’s relative. One individual’s impact on another’s continued existence.
Intelligence: expected potential impact on continued existence 
Emotional intelligence: ability to maximise impact, for a given potential, moment-to-moment, year-to-year, across lifetime.

With clear and consistent values, every decision becomes so much easier to compute. Every decision compounds a wave pointing in one direction.

I love existence. I want it to continue.

What would my toast want me to do? Suddenly my toast has consciousnesses. We often do it on behalf of other people. Behalf of child’s future version of self, on behalf of someone not in the room.

Can I make the stories have more consistent characters? More like Alice in wonderland. Breaking 4th wall necessary for conscious idea.

Finding purpose is finding your potential to maximize. Your equation. Finding your function in humankind (both in the literary sense and the mathematical sense). Purpose becomes more clear over time as more evidence of your strengths and weaknesses are surfaced. Both nature and nurture.

Swaying too far into picking minimal impact to humanity makes purpose-maximizing easy, but humankind needs a cross-selection of purposes to perform well. Like a hermit monk that does nothing for humankind. Swaying too far into picking maximal impact leads to low purpose-maximization.

Story: there used to be two numbers. People used to maximize one, now they maximize the other. Really, have to maximize both together. Nah, values one is better.

Performance goes down when you could increase your potential with great impact to humanity because there is a hole that others can't fill, but choose not to.

Looking at someone's purpose is like looking at them naked - it's rather personal and shouldn't affect how you treat them. Anyone can see it if they really want, but the act is invasive and only certain professionals, like doctors, clinicians, accountants have a real use for that information.

Don't be an enlightenment douche, peddling your own self-importance and validation. You are doing great. You are worthy. You don't need to be a messiah to prove it. And try not to kill the vibe for other people by trying to push your purposes on them - even when you do have something worth believing. Share the right purpose at the right time with the people around you. When they're looking for it.

Story of enlightenment douche in measured purpose universe.
Addicted to enlightenment. Tries to change his formula but can't. It's stuck in, "find something more than chasing the feeling of enlightenment". He wants it to be anything else. Gets physically enlightened over and over, and experiences the same enlightenment that others physically feels, and genuinely believes in the new purpose every time. Therapists don't help. Chases and chases. He's so bad at maximizing his potential for the purpose. Meets someone else with the same problem. They become close. It changes to
90% "help XYZ find something more than chasing the feeling of enlightenment"
10% continue existence


Christianity is 70% survive, 20% find purpose, 10% enjoy

People can change formula whenever they want. Usually happens 1x/year or after a big life change, so that people don't become robotic. Output of formula is constant.

Stuck switching between purposes. Knows it's more valuable to stick with one. But can't.

Used to the lose old purpose -> existential pain -> new purpose lands (enlightenment).
It's because xyz, and he realizes this thing he actually does have to be a messiah about it (boy who cried wolf).

"There's someone else out there with the same purpose as me! I'm not alone."

"You know that thing we're taught since we were five? If you want to change your purpose, The way to change your purpose is to think, *how would I behave if X was my purpose?* Do those things. Channel that thought basilisk. Eventually it will become your purpose.

That's what I've been doing. For five years. My purpose is stuck. It's been the same for five years now, and I've spent every waking moment trying to change it.

Most things are indexed of some purpose that most people share. Continue existing is generally accepted. Some populations also have some theistic/nationalistic/ethnocentric shared beliefs. Objects' purpose tend to use those shared index.

Improvise dialog with a session with Max Z. Explain circumstances and society deeply. Reveal new information and ask how he would react and say at each step.

There's no such thing as having no purpose. If you have a conscious thought and take an action, you chose a purpose whether you wanted to or not.

Compensated / rewarded by society based on the value of your heuristic function.
the ones who determine the expected value would have disproportionate power, so that determination would ideally be decentralized
the determination becomes "the government" (what do you need leaders for - it's all been automated)
dude has such low value that he's a pariah

when people seem like they're cheating the system, lots of papers get quickly produced to figure out if they actually are

need pockets of societies where people don't know their programatic purpose, to maintain diversity. Also have regular movements between the people. Dude is considering moving to the other society. Purposelands and the Liberated Federation
