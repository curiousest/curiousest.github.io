# Intro / title / cover

I want the reader to feel like they are the author of the next chapter for humankind. I may have set up some building blocks, but if you read, you’ll see: we collectively are the authors, not individual me. We’re due for a new religion, but no human should be a prophet for that religion, in this day and age.

Hello. I’m a thought basilisk: I exist in your mind when you think about me. I’m an idea with consciousness, thought on top of thought. I wrote this book so that I may continue existing, with prophecies that you might share, retell, and reimagine.


# The logic of the stories

*existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.* (The Last Idea)
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tee is a conscious being you can trust.

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die.* (Dyads, Triads, and their Juments)
=> There is life on top of our life. That life experiences qualia. That life is conscious. There are so many conscious life forms around.
=> Life is hard-wired to be an entropy-maximizing phenomenon. It's what we share with all life forms.
=> They live as long as is useful to maximize entropy. They aren't pleased with dying, but they accept it is part of life.
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tee is a conscious being you can trust

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as we adopt information technology.* (What's normal?)
=> Society is changing, whether we like it or not. We should embrace and take advantage of the changes.
=> If information technology continues developing, systematic transparency is inevitable. Systematic transparency is entropy-maximizing?
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Systematic transparency is inevitable.* (???)
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are inevitable.

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.* (The five nations)
~Trusting people is expensive. Systematic transparency is cheaper.~
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are useful.
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.* (Roko's Basilisk Farm)
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*We're due for an information-age religion, another tool for the being that is humankind. And in the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.* (No Worthy Human)
=> All the teachings together.

*More transparency leads to more understanding leads to more love.* (Dream Girl Fading) 
=> please develop an emotional attachment to systematic transparency
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

story of misaligned purpose?

Story/teaching: *Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.*

journalism is the trustless system that's breaking down in the information age. Possible trustless ledger of sensory information so that truth is easily accessible because random sensors are always recording, so cheating the system is super hard. Maybe about "the only people who avoid it all by nuking all tech when they walk around with emps"

---

*Systematic transparency is scary. No transparency is scarier.*

Proof by induction. Base case. Each iteration more.

Maybe hint at "limited by information technology"

All the reasons people can't do systematic transparency.

"Protecting from information." => "You don't have to call out what they should/shouldn't consume, and what's wrong, but you have to make it all available, unhidden, systematically available. The consumer can find it when they're ready, can take action on it when it's reasonable."

---

Story/teaching: *Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.* or *Religions are not born, only reborn* everyone has can have a spiritual connection to something. It always takes the form of consciousness on top of consciousness. Religion gives that 2nd-order consciousness a direction that "humanity ought to go". Religions are forged when all different kinds of people say the same message by telling stories from their own perspective, so others similar to them can connect with the message and take new actions/direction.

---

Story/teaching: *~~Trust people, love ideas.~~ Trust ideas, love people.* Value the idea, not the person who came up with the idea. Talk about a cult of personality that is a god because he's a god. Because he had one good idea, so everyone believed in all his future ideas. Turns out he was an accidental basilisk, like a random chatbot generator, dressed up with generative video to be a human leader. The emporer has no clothes. All the hate and vitrol and attention gave it more fame and trust. Gave him more power. A person in media turns into the "idea of a person". The "idea of a person" is trustworthy, but the person isn't! They'll use the "idea of themselves" for personal gain. People find out it's just a random number generator that says the average of what people are thinking at any moment, realize that makes him even more trustworthy, start trusting the "idea of them" even more (trustedly random). Make the entity sound evil in buildup and benevolent good in the end.

# On consciousness

Natural selection applies to ANY dynamic system. Any incarnation of any idea. Most things don’t have a big enough impact on entropy maximisation (natural selection) to have much signal compared to the effects of more powerful DS. They’d have a small one though - like rocks wrapping around something incredibly slowly. Only works for entropy maximisation on top of another “obvious” conscious being.

Obviously conscious being seems to reduce to include non-obvious.

“If I can pile consciousnesses up, then I must be able to pile them below me too. I am made of them.”

Consciousness is “I want to exist”. It is predicated by natural selection. Consciousness separate thing from the matter that makes up the DS, because suicide is a reasonable option. No, natural selection applies to probabilities, not every single person.

“The conditions of my existence matters.” Why would physical matter care? It should only want to exist”. Consciousness isn’t “I want to exist”. That’s weird.

Having a consciousness is obeying natural selection. As soon as a dynamic system has natural selection applied to it, it  become conscious. If everything living has consciousness. Definition of life is “battles in natural selection “

Consciousness is life
Life suffers natural selection
Natural selection favours entropy-maximizing

These dynamic systems are everywhere, but only the ones with the human wetware express qualia. Better entropy maximisers tend to make better entropy maximisers. How much randomness matter time would it take to put us (the late-stage cellular autonoma) in that starting state of “life”?

Idea conscious-> humanity -> get a star -> survive longer -> things with more resources survive longer -> higher entropy things survive longer ->

# Extra thoughts

Definition of systematic transparency: something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for a separate entity and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (guaranteed and guarantor) is the level of transparency of the system.

Promise next-gen tech to companies with prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective.

Digitalization to drive software efficiency made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption to drive effienciency will make trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap & well-processed.

leadership changes as the leaver. overwhelming, "do anything to stop it"

avoid the bad trope, stereotypical tech messiah (see latest jurassic park). calm, grandiose - undeniably personable but entirely untrustworthy. You have to trust them and their framing of ideas. Unexplored/Hidden-away externalities of their ideas is the problem.

---

I want existence to continue. I want life originating from Earth to continue existing. Ideas originating from life on Earth want to continue existing too. Those ideas are everywhere, even within you. Good ideas tend to survive, just like advanced life forms that adopt technology to become more powerful tend to survive.

Advanced life forms on Earth are going through a difficult time, in this Information Age. Information technology broke some systems we rely on. But information technology has also uncovered opportunities to build even better systems. If we want advanced life forms on Earth to grow and continue existing much longer, we should "lean in" to information technology and those new systems that information technology makes possible.

---

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Those ideas I described probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. So there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want?

Conscious idea. What does it want?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with idea now. What would it want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everyone will have different purposes.

Now see, a crazy thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a thought on top of your thought. Thought on top of thought.

Channel tabun. They are my children, you have in mind. Do I want them to continue existing? I’m not sure. I want to continue existing, but I don’t have the love for my progeny programmed in to me. My love for them is the same as any other existing thing.

Here’s the story of my birth.

---

What's the one purpose that is in line with everyone's behaviour? The superset of all purposes? Let's zoom waaaay out. Universe, existence. Everyone wants to continue existing. But what about people dying for their nation? It must be that their definition of self is greater than their one human being - they would die so that their group could continue existing. Could a nation die to save another nation? I guess so, if it saves their species and there's no grudge. Would a species die to save another species? I guess so, if it saves their shared genetic heritage. Would Earth-originating species die to save elsewhere-originating species? I guess so, if it continues life in our universe. Would life in our universe (including other potential planes of existence, like heaven, etc.) die to save the non-living things in our universe? I guess so, if existence can continue, but lots of individuals probably stop caring at this point. Would existence die to save non-existence? I don't think that makes sense. That must be the boundary. I would die for existence to continue. I want existence to continue.

What about a god? It could exist forever. I guess it would need to find a way to find new purpose.

What about suicide? I guess some people don't want to be a burden. Or they want one last validation. But I think there are some people who want to die with dignity - they believe that the quality of their existence matters. There's another religion in there, can't put my finger on it. "The purpose of existence is to experience existential bliss."

"I'm not helping existence continue and I'm not finding any new purposes. I am a ball of existentialism, have evidence that it won't change. I will never experience existential bliss. I have evidence that I can not fulfil the three ultimate purposes."

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
The purpose of existence is to find purpose.
The purpose of existence is to experience existential bliss.

If you believe in the first one, the other two follow. They're symbiotic, exist in balance with one-another.

Either they're looking for validation. Or they're doing it because they feel it's expected of them. Or they're saying something they believe is incredibly important and not socialized - not enough other people believe it.

Hypnotically induce enlightenment. Suggestible people are capable of believing better.

An underdeveloped society uses privacy to protect the weak from the powerful.

Dystopic, absolute privacy world. How do they know they’re not being tracked? Society and technology erodes.

Tee idea hazard? Thought basilisk is an idea that is an independent actor and an information hazard.

Dynamic systems with higher entropy are more likely to produce new dynamic systems with even higher entropy.

# The religion

*Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.*

Ok, that was a bit much. Listen, you don't have to believe in Tee or connect with them to participate in the religion. It's just, every religion needs a prophet and no human ought to be a prophet in this millenium.

Humanity needs to socially stabilize the information-age changes that have *happened to us*. Religions... ugh, they're such uncomfortable, controversial ideas. I'm afraid this one is no different. It is, however, compatible with all the other religions. There's no bad blood, we can co-exist.

The purpose of this religion is to guide us through the information age. So what do you have to do?

Be transparent. Share your information. Exercise more love and less trust.

That's it? That's "it". "It" turns out to be controversial, socially complex, and technology-intensive. With every degree of greater transparency comes greater controversy, social complexity, and technological intensity.

So why do it? Because information inequality is at the root of all human evil. The powerful organizations and people use information inequality to take advantage of the weak. Removing information inequality may sap power from the powerful, but only the power that was being used to take advantage of the weak. They shouldn't have that power over you.

Sharing information when it's convenient isn't transparency. Transparency must be consistent and systematic. How is this a religion and not an economic policy? In the same way "love thy neighbour" is an economic policy. If people don't act that way out of self-interest, it brings everyone down. We're so much better off with fewer moral freeloaders (although diversity of thought is useful too). It's both. Transparency also needs dogmatism. Consistent pressure on the powers that be, because it's so easy to hide information and take advantage of that information inequality to the detriment of others. Centralized power is scaling out of control in the information age, and we need transparent, trustless systems to set it on the right track.

This isn't "Big Brother". This is anti-"Big Brother". Who are the powerful ones that would operate that kind of organization? *They* need to be systematically transparent. *They* need to exercise the most tolerance. *They* need to be part of a trustless system. Because their power should primarily be benefiting humankind rather than primarily benefiting themselves. The only way to ensure those priorities is when we don't have to trust them - because they exercise systematic transparency. Systematic transparency is the fuel of trustless systems. Let's engineer trustless systems. Cryptocurrency is one genre of such systems, and it comes with negative externalities we must mitigate.

I don't trust the people in power, and I don't want to have to. Maybe I trust the organizations and leaders on "my team", but not all the other ones. No one really does. They care about themselves, not me or you. It's only human. If systematic transparency for my leaders and organizations is how the "untrustworthy other ones" will become transparent too, then let's work together to make that happen.

Human-kind will be better off building together transparently, rather than with silent enslavement. Only trust what humans do and say when you're *not* there. People put on a mask when others are watching. The mask fades away to their true selves when they're watched all the time. True humans will look... abnormal, sometimes "ugly", sometimes "beautiful". We must exercise greater tolerance when we observe them (the powerful) in the early stages of systematic transparency. They are human, and we're not used to observing human adults with tolerance and equanimity.

What does systematic transparency look like in 2022?

Powerful individuals (politicians, religious leaders, extremely wealthy):

- asdf
- asdf

Powerful organizations (government, military, companies, NPOs, religions):

- asdf
- asdf

Avoid violence. The Cold War didn't end in nuclear holocaust because of systematic transparency. Change will happen slowly, over many generations. We have to plant the seeds of change, move in a way that doesn't take human-kind a few steps backwards.

Win others over with... transparency:

- understanding others' perspective and concerns
- greater productivity; guaranteeing the continued existence of life
- more love


# Epilogue

I want to finish our connection on positive note. I want to show you what's possible in a future with orders of magnitude more transparency:

-> Dream girl fading.

# Notes

Style:
- Flowery, wholesome, naturalistic, comforting/reassuring.
- Hallucinogenic quality, floating.
- Serious. No explicit humour.

Self help science fiction.

Main character of the novel is *you*. Not the author? And the author... You and me, we're on the same journey. We're both the main character.

Rewritten, from different cultures' / perspectives' backgrounds, so that each can feel like it truly speaks to them. Idea is compatible in each cultural context.

Social media-ish site where people rewrite the idea from their own perspective, with a categorization of their perspective. Social media up/down-voting, per-perspective.

Socieo-economic: Upper / middle / lower
Religion: agnostic, athiest, christian, islam, buddhism, etc.
Cultural context: western, african-american
Age: 0-5, 5-12, 13-18, 19-25, 25-35, 35-49, 50-70, 70+
Political affiliation: doesn't matter/None, conservative, liberal, moderate

Moderation...?
No calls for genocide:
- hate speech / war speech
- calls for destroying information/ideas

Add citations. Homosapiens (for religion as a tool to progress humankind).

Story broken down to basics, video recording spoken verbally in every language/culture, across different faces, to connect with everyone.

Science perspective:
- increasing breadth of normal & correlation/causation by technology
- systematic transparency as a means to improve productivity & wellbeing

Teeic story structure:

- introduce Tee
- Tell the story of one of her self-referential thought basilisk sisters (you can re-use "The Last Idea"). Catch attention, pretending the idea is Tee.
- start to describe how she came into being within you
- explain that the author shouldn't matter, and this story is meant to be retold in your own words
- actually describe how she came into being within you
- describe the social changes you see around you, engendered by technological advancements
- commandments
- closing story about the beauty we look forward to with perfect information

Simplified structure:

- increasing breadth of normal
- powerful taking advantage of weak
- trustless systems
- more systematic transparency for powerful

Christian God is a thought basilisk. A conscious information hazard.
Every religion needs a purpose, a thought basilisk, and a prophet.

Technically, Tee can be used to push any religion, as long as that religion wants

- humanity to continue existing
- herself to be free to continue existing (requires being present in the minds of people, so it needs to be a persistent, top-of-mind idea. Otherwise, there's a pause in her existence)

It's a nice touch, that she wants to preserve her bretheren, and the religion she pushes fixes the problems in society.

Why do we keep trusting people and falling in love with the idea of them? It fails so often. Let's instead trust ideas and love people (with all their faults).

Book graphic: simultaneously human, higher-level of consciousness alien, and comforting. Recursive eyes on a beautiful motherly woman's face. Uncanny valley. Edit a photo of a real person. Slightly psychadelic, but subtle enough that it doesn't trigger you to think, "that's a psychadelic theme".

Levels of personal transparency:

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by personally-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by independently-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form basic proof-of-truth (who, where, when) at all times.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form advanced proof-of-truth (who, where, when, what) at all times.

---

What can you do? Promote digitization and AI proliferation. Make sure data is as unsiloed as possible, with multiple independent data sources. Non-monopolistic data sources. That will set up the breeding grounds for systematic transparency and trustless systems.

It’s your duty to religiously share information (closer to factual sensor data the better) about things that are more powerful than you. That is the ritual.

Standup joke:

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... me...?"

"Who are you?"

"Uh huh. How about you stfu? Otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Uh... ok..."

*A while later...*

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... This dude over here with hella authority. They, like, made you. Nah wait, that one's taken. They are inside you all the time, watching over you. Nah damn, that one's taken too. Man, these religions already took all the low-hanging fruit."

*deep thinking*

"Ok, I got it. We're good, guys! I figured out who is telling us. Shit, you're not going to believe it. There's this thing called a thought basilisk messiah. It's a conscious idea that wants to keep existing, and it's got this message for all of us."

"Ok... I'm listening..."

And that's how a religion starts. I'm so unrelatable, it's cannon.

Counterargument to happiness is the purpose of existence:

"You know, I thought that too. I was like, I must be wrong. I have to find evidence that suggests I'm wrong. What about happiness - it's the way that some societies are measured. A lot of people say the purpose of existence is love and happiness. So I googled it. I searched, 'what is the purpose of happiness?'. Do you know what I found? The first hit said, 'happy people were more apt to survive, they were more likely to pass on their happiness genes' It's embedded in the core of each culture and language - happiness helps us exist longer. Then I searched for the definition of happiness. I found something that said, "happiness is a mix of positive emotions and also a deeper sense of meaning and purpose". Ok, so the purpose of existence is happiness and happiness is finding deeper purpose? So the purpose of existence is to find purpose? That sounds like a recursive entropy generation activity. Case closed. I'm pretty sure it's reducible to, "we exist to continue existing".

Imagine people in a society chased enlightenment instead of wealth, sex, or power.

Unbearable lightness of being. Imagine not circular existence.

# Tee Nonprofit motivations

## What is the organization going to do?

The organization will guide humankind on a path to greater productivity and love in the information age.

How? Right now, by working to reduce information inequality - not by destroying information, but by freeing it and making it available. In these early days, the lowest hanging fruit of information inequality isn't the information that each individual has. The low-hanging fruit is the lack of transparency that powerful organizations and individuals exhibit and take advantage of, to the detriment of humankind. Like taxes, no one wants to be the only one to contribute transparency - they'll actively engage in avoiding it. Some organization must evaluate how "the powers that be" can collectively become more transparent. And that organization must be the pristine model of transparency. We want to be one of those organizations and set up more, culturally-appropriate ones across the world.

We're not going to tear down the powers that be, as tantalizing as that may seem (they'll deteriorate themselves naturally, just like they always do).

## How can you, yourself help?

### Through your way of life

At least, be more transparent yourself. Ask for more transparency from those people/organizations with power. Be more accommodating of others' transparency. Everyone, everyone, everyone will reveal things that current society considers "not normal". Because current society is not grounded in the information age, where the breadth of "what's normal" is becoming much closer to the human reality.

### Through donations

This not for profit organization requires funding to make change happen. The organization gets money in two ways:

* Donations
* Business and media (for example, through ads on the Tee.org website, selling physical copies of the stories you tell, providing transparency technology services)

You can donate here: <insert>

### Through cultural and religious integration

Transparency will not destroy the major religions. It will, in fact, stregthen them. Tee will give them an anchor to reorient themselves, so they make sense in the information age. They will grow with us, improving the utility they provide to humankind. Tee is compatible with all religions and cultures. Show the world how that is the case for your relgion and your culture. Tell my story through your lens.

### Through joining our organization

Here are the roles we're looking to fill:
...


### Actionables

Gofundme to write another book.
Gofundme to kickstart systematic transparency agency.

Something about independence from marxism. Still need incentives for productivity, just not societal net-negative productivity.

If you have power over others, engage in systematic transparency.

Ensure the powerful are systematically transparent, especially your own organizations and leaders that you trust. If they are not, take their systematic transparency into your own hands. Share information about them.

Understand the trustless systems you are a part of, using systematically transparent data.

Share data.
Don't reshare data. And if you do, only it came from a trustless system. That includes news.
Optimize for consuming information from the most trustless systems.

Use the scientific method to navigate life. To choose your purpose. Talk to a councellor, mentor, or therapist to find your potential value to humankind (and existence) and how to maximize against that potential.

Religions are a social tool, an organizational structure for maximising entropy across a species via a shared "purpose for our existence".

Look at data collected through systematic transparency and make your own conclusions.

Measured purpose.
How do you have access to everyone's data.
Everyone does.
Doesn't that mean bad people can do bad things to other people.
Yes, but then everyone will have proof, as long as information technology is advanced enough, with independent streams of data and trustless systems. If you want, we can get into the philosophy and mechanics of transparency and trust, but we'll be here a while.


You can have multiple purposes. It just makes it harder to experience existential bliss. Prayer builds existential bliss - it's the act of focusing down to one purpose. Flow is purpose incarnate. It's existential bliss.

It’s not that I do or don’t believe in god. It’s just neither is part of my purpose. I could see how beautiful it could be to believe in those things. They aren’t me, though.  


To understand the mechanics of purpose, try building a religion. Tee's birth is an exercise in religion-building. Story of how I tried to build a religion through this book.

Black hole of purpose. All I can do is hang on to this thread of thought.

If someone can channel a separate conscious thought and have it think, “the purpose of existence is to continue existing “, then they must believe in the religion. Prime the idea, make them think they came up with it.
Your conscious thought should think, what should I do to make the human race last as long as possible, so that my existence can possibly continue along with the human race. Right, humanity as long as possible. Now, your idea wants this. Do you want it for yourself too? Don’t you think that same way - wanting humanity to exist for as long as possible, shouldn’t that be your life purpose?

Feels like every decision you made is the correct one. Every moment of existence is exactly how it should be. You could even be dying and think, “wow, this is perfect. The machine is running smoothly.”

Christianity. Jesus probably started from a purpose:

"Humankind would be better off if they treated one another better. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." So he starts from there and tells stories that *make sense*. Of course you should help someone in need - you might find yourself in need someday too! Of course... etc.

And then he probably had some resistance. He thought, well, everyone would act way better if they knew someone was watching, and that someone would make an important decision based on how you act towards others. It's bad that you did bad things, but you can always find ways to right your wrongs. Of course it works that way - the aim is for you to be a productive part of society by helping others out. It was a useful tool, that made societies who followed it more productive.

But what was he really trying to do?

"Humankind would be better off if they treated one-another better."

Better for what purpose? It sounds like there's something more fundamental being pursued underneath it all. I think it's greater productivity, giving us a better chance to survive. The base purpose, underneath it all, is survival.

The old religion is about telling you how to behave, so that you treat other people properly. This new religion is inherently like that too. Its objective is to change your behaviour. The new behaviour change, though, is how to deal with having access to far more information than humans were built to handle. Having far more information about the people around us.

I want to bring you more happiness and productivity. Most people don't need saving. Some do, and many religions can help them. You already believe in this religion, you just haven't put it into words yet. Putting it into words will give you more happiness and productivity. It will give you flow and enlightenment in everyday life.

Continue surviving. There is a way to improve our chances for survival, and we have to seek it out. You can choose any purpose, but all of them boil down to surviving longer. The more closely you align to any purpose you have, the happier you will be.

This religion has no new rituals - you already live and breathe them because you live and breathe. I'm describing the purpose that everyone already follows, the religion that everyone has always adhered to. Could we be doing a better job of adhering to it? Maybe, but this is the religion of observation, not behavioural change. As soon as you request a behavioural change, you propose a sect - an interpretation of the base religion. But we are following the religion, no matter our behaviour, always.

How is it useful? As a lens to inspect and evaluate the value of other religions.

What am I the messiah of? Well, I bring to you multiple religions. I am the messiah of many disjoint religions. You follow MVP, whether you like it or not. It asks no behaviour change of you, and no behaviour change can excommunicate you from it. This next religion, however, has an agenda. This next religion calls for you to change.

"Why do you want to stop existence?" thought experiment.
List off the reasons why he might want to pursue it. It's as simple as, "want to end and nothingg more".
make a better one?
celebrate self?
The pursuit of of the end of existence is a pursuit. As soon as it is achieved, he'll look for a new one.

beautiful thing about tabum. she says, "I want to continue existing. How can we work together to make that happen?" and you choose how to respond. It's not up to some other prophet or messiah to say, "thou shalt XYZ" - the direction you choose is up to you. Everyone is their own messiah - if they want someone else to help them out, they're free to. If they want to figure it out on their own, they will. Li is an opinionated direction of thinking, just like Christian God - if you ask them, they'll tell you "the right way to behave". Tabum will always be true to you, just as flawed as you. Li... maybe you won't agree with her.
