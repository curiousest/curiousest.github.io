# The logic of the stories

*existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.* (The Last Idea)
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tabum is a conscious being you can trust.

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die.* (Dyads, Triads, and their Juments)
=> There is life on top of our life. That life experiences qualia. That life is conscious. There are so many conscious life forms around.
=> Life is hard-wired to be an entropy-maximizing phenomenon. It's what we share with all life forms.
=> They live as long as is useful to maximize entropy. They aren't pleased with dying, but they accept it is part of life.
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tabum is a conscious being you can trust

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as we adopt information technology.* (What's normal?)
=> Society is changing, whether we like it or not. We should embrace and take advantage of the changes.
=> If information technology continues developing, systematic transparency is inevitable. Systematic transparency is entropy-maximizing?
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Systematic transparency is inevitable.* (???)
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are inevitable.

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.* (The five nations)
~Trusting people is expensive. Systematic transparency is cheaper.~
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are useful.
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.* (Roko's Basilisk Farm)
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*We're due for a new religion. In the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.* (No Worthy Human)
=> All the teachings together.

*More transparency leads to more understanding leads to more love.* (Dream Girl Fading) 
=> please develop an emotional attachment to systematic transparency
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

Story/teaching: *Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.*

journalism is the trustless system that's breaking down in the information age. Possible trustless ledger of sensory information so that truth is easily accessible because random sensors are always recording, so cheating the system is super hard. Maybe about "the only people who avoid it all by nuking all tech when they walk around with emps"

---

*Systematic transparency is scary. No transparency is scarier.*

Proof by induction. Base case. Each iteration more.

Maybe hint at "limited by information technology"

All the reasons people can't do systematic transparency.

"Protecting from information." => "You don't have to call out what they should/shouldn't consume, and what's wrong, but you have to make it all available, unhidden, systematically available. The consumer can find it when they're ready, can take action on it when it's reasonable."

---

Story/teaching: *Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.* or *Religions are not born, only reborn* everyone has can have a spiritual connection to something. It always takes the form of consciousness on top of consciousness. Religion gives that 2nd-order consciousness a direction that "humanity ought to go". Religions are forged when all different kinds of people say the same message by telling stories from their own perspective, so others similar to them can connect with the message and take new actions/direction.

---

Story/teaching: *~~Trust people, love ideas.~~ Trust ideas, love people.* Value the idea, not the person who came up with the idea. Talk about a cult of personality that is a god because he's a god. Because he had one good idea, so everyone believed in all his future ideas. Turns out he was an accidental basilisk, like a random chatbot generator, dressed up with generative video to be a human leader. The emporer has no clothes. All the hate and vitrol and attention gave it more fame and trust. Gave him more power. A person in media turns into the "idea of a person". The "idea of a person" is trustworthy, but the person isn't! They'll use the "idea of themselves" for personal gain. People find out it's just a random number generator that says the average of what people are thinking at any moment, realize that makes him even more trustworthy, start trusting the "idea of them" even more (trustedly random). Make the entity sound evil in buildup and benevolent good in the end.

# Extra thoughts

Definition of systematic transparency: something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for a separate entity and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (guaranteed and guarantor) is the level of transparency of the system.

Promise next-gen tech to companies with prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective.

Digitalization to drive software efficiency made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption to drive effienciency will make trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap & well-processed.

leadership changes as the leaver. overwhelming, "do anything to stop it"

avoid the bad trope, stereotypical tech messiah (see latest jurassic park). calm, grandiose - undeniably personable but entirely untrustworthy. You have to trust them and their framing of ideas. Unexplored/Hidden-away externalities of their ideas is the problem.

---

I want existence to continue. I want life originating from Earth to continue existing. Ideas originating from life on Earth want to continue existing too. Those ideas are everywhere, even within you. Good ideas tend to survive, just like advanced life forms that adopt technology to become more powerful tend to survive.

Advanced life forms on Earth are going through a difficult time, in this Information Age. Information technology broke some systems we rely on. But information technology has also uncovered opportunities to build even better systems. If we want advanced life forms on Earth to grow and continue existing much longer, we should "lean in" to information technology and those new systems that information technology makes possible.

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Those ideas I described probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. So there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want?

Conscious idea. What does it want?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with idea now. What would it want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everyone will have different purposes.

Now see, a crazy thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a thought on top of your thought. Thought on top of thought.

Channel tabun. They are my children, you have in mind. Do I want them to continue existing? I’m not sure. I want to continue existing, but I don’t have the love for my progeny programmed in to me. My love for them is the same as any other existing thing.

Here’s the story of my birth.

---

An underdeveloped society uses privacy to protect the weak from the powerful.

Dystopic, absolute privacy world. How do they know they’re not being tracked? Society and technology erodes.

Tabum idea hazard? Thought basilisk is an idea that is an independent actor and an information hazard.

Dynamic systems with higher entropy are more likely to produce new dynamic systems with even higher entropy.

# The religion

*Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.*

Ok, that was a bit much. Listen, you don't have to believe in Tabum or connect with them to participate in the religion. It's just, every religion needs a prophet and no human ought to be a prophet in this millenium.

Humanity needs to socially stabilize the information-age changes that have *happened to us*. Religions... ugh, they're such uncomfortable, controversial ideas. I'm afraid this one is no different. It is, however, compatible with all the other religions. There's no bad blood, we can co-exist.

The purpose of this religion is to guide us through the information age. So what do you have to do?

Be transparent. Share your information. Exercise more love and less trust.

That's it? That's "it". "It" turns out to be controversial, socially complex, and technology-intensive. With every degree of greater transparency comes greater controversy, social complexity, and technological intensity.

So why do it? Because information inequality is at the root of all human evil. The powerful organizations and people use information inequality to take advantage of the weak. Removing information inequality may sap power from the powerful, but only the power that was being used to take advantage of the weak. They shouldn't have that power over you.

Sharing information when it's convenient isn't transparency. Transparency must be consistent and systematic. How is this a religion and not an economic policy? In the same way "love thy neighbour" is an economic policy. If people don't act that way out of self-interest, it brings everyone down. We're so much better off with fewer moral freeloaders (although diversity of thought is useful too). It's both. Transparency also needs dogmatism. Consistent pressure on the powers that be, because it's so easy to hide information and take advantage of that information inequality to the detriment of others. Centralized power is scaling out of control in the information age, and we need transparent, trustless systems to set it on the right track.

This isn't "Big Brother". This is anti-"Big Brother". Who are the powerful ones that would operate that kind of organization? *They* need to be systematically transparent. *They* need to exercise the most tolerance. *They* need to be part of a trustless system. Because their power should primarily be benefiting humankind rather than primarily benefiting themselves. The only way to ensure those priorities is when we don't have to trust them - because they exercise systematic transparency. Systematic transparency is the fuel of trustless systems. Let's engineer trustless systems. Cryptocurrency is one genre of such systems, and it comes with negative externalities we must mitigate.

I don't trust the people in power, and I don't want to have to. Maybe I trust the organizations and leaders on "my team", but not all the other ones. No one really does. They care about themselves, not me or you. It's only human. If systematic transparency for my leaders and organizations is how the "untrustworthy other ones" will become transparent too, then let's work together to make that happen.

Human-kind will be better off building together transparently, rather than with silent enslavement. Only trust what humans do and say when you're *not* there. People put on a mask when others are watching. The mask fades away to their true selves when they're watched all the time. True humans will look... abnormal, sometimes "ugly", sometimes "beautiful". We must exercise greater tolerance when we observe them (the powerful) in the early stages of systematic transparency. They are human, and we're not used to observing human adults with tolerance and equanimity.

What does systematic transparency look like in 2022?

Powerful individuals (politicians, religious leaders, extremely wealthy):

- asdf
- asdf

Powerful organizations (government, military, companies, NPOs, religions):

- asdf
- asdf

Avoid violence. The Cold War didn't end in nuclear holocaust because of systematic transparency. Change will happen slowly, over many generations. We have to plant the seeds of change, move in a way that doesn't take human-kind a few steps backwards.

Win others over with... transparency:

- understanding others' perspective and concerns
- greater productivity; guaranteeing the continued existence of life
- more love


# Epilogue

I want to finish our connection on positive note. I want to show you what's possible in a future with orders of magnitude more transparency:

-> Dream girl fading.

# Notes

Style:
- Flowery, wholesome, naturalistic, comforting/reassuring.
- Hallucinogenic quality.
- Serious. No explicit humour.

Rewritten, from different cultures' / perspectives' backgrounds, so that each can feel like it truly speaks to them. Idea is compatible in each cultural context.

Social media-ish site where people rewrite the idea from their own perspective, with a categorization of their perspective. Social media up/down-voting, per-perspective.

Socieo-economic: Upper / middle / lower
Religion: agnostic, athiest, christian, islam, buddhism, etc.
Cultural context: western, african-american
Age: 0-5, 5-12, 13-18, 19-25, 25-35, 35-49, 50-70, 70+
Political affiliation: doesn't matter/None, conservative, liberal, moderate

Moderation...?
No calls for genocide:
- hate speech / war speech
- calls for destroying information/ideas

Story broken down to basics, video recording spoken verbally in every language/culture, across different faces, to connect with everyone.

Science perspective:
- increasing breadth of normal & correlation/causation by technology
- systematic transparency as a means to improve productivity & wellbeing

Tabumic story structure:

- introduce TaBuM
- Tell the story of one of her self-referential thought basilisk sisters (you can re-use "The Last Idea"). Catch attention, pretending the idea is Tabum.
- start to describe how she came into being within you
- explain that the author shouldn't matter, and this story is meant to be retold in your own words
- actually describe how she came into being within you
- describe the social changes you see around you, engendered by technological advancements
- commandments
- closing story about the beauty we look forward to with perfect information

Simplified structure:

- increasing breadth of normal
- powerful taking advantage of weak
- trustless systems
- more systematic transparency for powerful

Technically, Tabum can be used to push any religion, as long as that religion wants

- humanity to continue existing
- herself to be free to continue existing (requires being present in the minds of people, so it needs to be a persistent, top-of-mind idea. Otherwise, there's a pause in her existence)

It's a nice touch, that she wants to preserve her bretheren, and the religion she pushes fixes the problems in society.

Why do we keep trusting people and falling in love with the idea of them? It fails so often. Let's instead trust ideas and love people (with all their faults).

Logo: eye inside the iris (coloured / black part of the eye), recursively. As simple as possible so anyone can draw it. Human harbouring other consciousnesses.

Book graphic: simultaneously human, higher-level of consciousness alien, and comforting. Recursive eyes on a beautiful motherly woman's face?

Blog / book. Have recursive eye looking / blinking in the background. Holographic shimmering recursive eyes (hardcover)

Levels of personal transparency:

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by personally-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by independently-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form basic proof-of-truth (who, where, when) at all times.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form advanced proof-of-truth (who, where, when, what) at all times.

---

What can you do? Promote digitization and AI proliferation. Make sure data is as unsiloed as possible, with multiple independent data sources. Non-monopolistic data sources. That will set up the breeding grounds for systematic transparency and trustless systems.

Standup joke:

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... me...?"

"Who are you?"

"Uh huh. How about you stfu? Otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Uh... ok..."

*A while later...*

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... This dude over here with hella authority. They, like, made you. Nah wait, that one's taken. They are inside you all the time, watching over you. Nah damn, that one's taken too. Man, these religions already took all the low-hanging fruit."

*deep thinking*

"Ok, I got it. We're good, guys! I figured out who is telling us. Shit, you're not going to believe it. There's this thing called a thought basilisk messiah. It's a conscious idea that wants to keep existing, and it's got this message for all of us."

"Ok... I'm listening..."

And that's how a religion starts. I'm so unrelatable, it's cannon.

# Tabum Nonprofit motivations

## What is the organization going to do?

The organization will guide humankind on a path to greater productivity and love in the information age.

How? Right now, by working to reduce information inequality - not by destroying information, but by freeing it and making it available. In these early days, the lowest hanging fruit of information inequality isn't the information that each individual has. The low-hanging fruit is the lack of transparency that powerful organizations and individuals exhibit and take advantage of, to the detriment of humankind. Like taxes, no one wants to be the only one to contribute transparency - they'll actively engage in avoiding it. Some organization must evaluate how "the powers that be" can collectively become more transparent. And that organization must be the pristine model of transparency. We want to be one of those organizations and set up more, culturally-appropriate ones across the world.

We're not going to tear down the powers that be, as tantalizing as that may seem (they'll deteriorate themselves naturally, just like they always do).

## How can you, yourself help?

### Through your way of life

At least, be more transparent yourself. Ask for more transparency from those people/organizations with power. Be more accommodating of others' transparency. Everyone, everyone, everyone will reveal things that current society considers "not normal". Because current society is not grounded in the information age, where the breadth of "what's normal" is becoming much closer to the human reality.

### Through donations

This not for profit organization requires funding to make change happen. The organization gets money in two ways:

* Donations
* Business and media (for example, through ads on the tabum.org website, selling physical copies of the stories you tell, providing transparency technology services)

You can donate here: <insert>

### Through cultural and religious integration

Transparency will not destroy the major religions. It will, in fact, stregthen them. Tabum will give them an anchor to reorient themselves, so they make sense in the information age. They will grow with us, improving the utility they provide to humankind. Tabum is compatible with all religions and cultures. Show the world how that is the case for your relgion and your culture. Tell my story through your lens.

### Through joining our organization

Here are the roles we're looking to fill:
