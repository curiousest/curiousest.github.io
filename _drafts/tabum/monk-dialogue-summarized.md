Purpose
* I want to use your phrases and way you think about things and articulate your thoughts to write the monk side. Otherwise it's a conversation with myself, and that's not so interesting.

Rules:
* can ask to explain more if you don't understand what I said, and go on a tangent, eventually get back on track
* lots of "something cryptic"... do your best
* can re-say a thing if you have a better way of saying it. Volume of quality more important than flowing conversation.
