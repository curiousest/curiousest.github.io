Before I become omniscient, I want to re-remember one last test for the fun of it. To see if anything has changed yet.

Early in my search, I ran a test with a human monk. I saw his life journey, his every waking moment. From ten years old struggling in a rough backwater, spending his 20s troubled and dangerous - a complex youth. I saw him become enlightened. He chose a simple life of blissful existence. He had everything figured out. By age 50, he was an expert at living life exactly how he believed he should live it.

I knew everything he knew, but I wanted to talk through a problem I had been mulling. I took the form of a troubled human young man, 28 years of age, exactly as the monk imagined himself in his earlier years. A youth just on the edge of realizing his life mistakes, ripe for enlightenment. The monk would be falling over himself to spark that enlightenment - this young man would remember the monk forever as the one who sparked enlightenment. Divine validation, divine satisfaction.

I came to the monk, a dishevelled man. He opened his doors to the public most days in the afternoon, after he had meditated for two hours. No one else was looking for his guidance today - I made sure of it. I peered through the doorway, displaying hesitation.

"Please, come in. It's much cooler in here than out there. Far more comfortable."

"I, I saw you're here to... You can talk through some things?"

"Of course, these office hours are one of my favourite things. I love getting to know the people I share the world with. Come, sit."

I sat across from him. The room was corporate hellscape. It must have been recently converted from a place of beaureacratic worship to spiritual processing. Soulless shades of grey and beige screaming, "Your brain is here for its computational power. Please suppress feelings, squeeze out every last drop of compute." He had covered the worst of it with varied Eastern spiritual decor. Like a leafy patch of enlightenment in the belly of the capitalist machine, faint colour in corporate purgatory. Like a leafy globe of life floating in endlessly spacious nothingness.

"Ok... So I've been thinking these things. It's been pretty hard for me. It's hard for me to say, but.. I'm really not sure about things. I came here to understand. I think if I can answer this one question, I'll know what path I have to take in life. When I think of the happiest people in the world, people who appear happy all the time, I think of monks like you. But few people want to be a monk. So why are monks so happy, and everyone wants to be happy and says things like "the purpose of life is to pursue happiness", but no one wants to be a monk?"

The monk looked through me, silent and non-judging. Waiting for more of my words.

"You are enlightened, right? What does it feel like?"

"Ha. It feels pretty good. It feels like I understand everything. Just about every waking moment, I know what I must do. Mmm. Do you know about flow? Yes. It's like being in flow all the time, like I'm always 'doing' a thing. Even when I'm figuring out what to do next, that's part of 'doing exactly what I must do.'"

"That sounds amazing. See, I'm going through some... changes. Some things came up and want to take a new path in life, and I'm trying to figure out what direction to go [more specific choices]. On one path I could be 'happy" like you and on another path I could be 'important' to the world. Of course I want to be happy, but if I choose that path, I feel like I won't be... doing the 'right' thing, doing something like, *meaningful* you know? I can be happy or I can do something meaningful. If I choose to be happy, I won't really be happy. I'm so confused."

"It's pretty confusing, yes. But it's not a "one or the other" choice. You can be happy and have a whole lot of meaning in your life. You can do very impactful things and live a full, happy life."

"It doesn't feel that way. It feels like if I choose happiness, my life won't feel meaningful, so I won't be happy. If I choose to do really meaningful things, every day will be such a slog - I'll be unhappy the whole time. I have to choose between gluttony and grinding life out, it's either not happy or not happy. How is that a choice? How do I choose?"

"Why not have both? How about grinding through those meaningful things and engorging in gluttony together? You can down that junkfood while you're working. You can binge on media on a treadmill. *laughs* Isn't that a little funny, when we mix it together, they sound like happy things. When you're choosing between the two kinds of suffering you're also choosing between two kinds of happiness."

"Hmmm. I see what you mean. That's comforting. Still, I have to lean more towards one kind of happiness, either the "feel good sensations now" kind of happiness or the "live a life worth living" kind. You said earlier, you feel like you're doing 'exactly the right thing in every waking moment', but how come everyone doesn't want to be a monk? It seems like a shortcut to "feel good sensations now" all the time. Don't you feel bad about meditating all day, like everyone else thinks you could be doing something more useful with your time? So you and everyone else have different priorities. So who is right - everyone else or you?"

"Ha - I used to get up to some pretty terrible things. 'Everyone else' probably thinks meditating all day is a much better option. Anyways, this is about you. I understand. I see what you're saying. I think it will help if... Can you give me an example of a person that everyone else believes is doing exactly the right thing in every waking moment?"

"I guess it's not necessarily successful people... Successful people always seem to do things for themselves first and everyone else second. Well, maybe some successful people think of others first, but not many of them. I guess...  it's the people that choose to do the things that are best for everyone else, to the best of their ability. And they usually have some special skills or missions that others don't have. Like the best teachers that can uniquely inspire students, and get them to learn when other teachers can't. Or nurses that labour tirelessly to heal people. So what can I do? Can you tell me?"

"You have to figure that out for yourself."

"That's not very helpful. What does everyone else care about?"

"I think there's a way to explore this. There are different religions. Different people have different purposes of existence. Different religions have a different 'meaning of life'"

"Yeah but religion is a bit out of fashion. I don't think I want one of those."

"Haha. Do you worship cash? Or idolize a successful artist? Or have a favourite tech or clothing brand? Religions are more common than you think."

"Surely there's some shared direction that we're all going, regardless of religion."

"I hear you. We're all in this together. But everyone has a different religion. Everyone has a different base direction."

"Yeah, but religions always want you to do weird stuff. They want you behave a different way. What I mean is, there must be something that describes the direction we're going, no matter how we behave."

"Maybe some things aren't meant to be known. Maybe it's only for the gods."

"That's an easy out. What if that thing we're all doing is knowable by anyone and easy to describe. What do we know about everything in existence? Well, it exists or it doesn't. Things that exist generally want to continue existing, except for some rare circumstances. Let's look at what the internet says... Here. Wikipedia."

* To realize one's potential and ideals
* To achieve biological perfection
* To seek wisdom and knowledge
* To do good, to do the right thing
* Meanings relating to religion: be with God, go to heaven, etc.
* To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living
* To have power, to be better
* Life has no meaning
* One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life

"So we're going to say it's knowable and it has to apply to everything and every religion. So we can cross out a couple of them."

"Love?"

"That sounds like a mix of survival and something else - there's some loss-aversion in there. There's certainly some way to describe all these feelings, where more is better. I think happiness is a better word for that."

"Ok, a third thing. I see many words about the same idea: 'realize potential', 'achieve perfection', 'seek knowledge', 'be better'. They're all about growth. So I should survive, grow, be happy. That's what everyone wants me to do."

"I thought you meant that's what everyone is doing. You said you shouldn't have to change your behaviour, right?"

"Right. And so the thing I'm doing now. I'm growing to figure out how to make me and society survive. Hopefully in doing so, it makes me happy. Wow, I feel a lot better already. What do I need to figure out again? What I should be doing with my life. I need to find the greatest impact I can have on making myself last longer."

"Your sense of self seems to encompass many people, and that's a beautiful thing. I can see you doing great things for society."

"Really? I didn't know that. Wait, what does that mean?"

"The way I like to think about it is, different people have different sizes of 'self'. People with bigger senses of self tend to do the things that benefit larger groups of people, even when it's at the cost of their individual single-person self. Yours seems pretty big, if you care about what so many people want from you."

"How come you don't?"

"I guess I'm a bit naive. Maybe I don't have the same powers as you. Maybe I haven't put in the time to grow my sense of self. Who knows."

"So I should place a bet on the best course of action for the group I care about. I should make that happen to the best of my abilities."

"Sounds like a worthy life to me."

"Why hasn't anyone told me this before? It's pretty straightforward, pretty logical. It'd save everyone a lot of time and anguish if people were more upfront about all of this."

"If you find it so simple, I would love to see how you would teach this to others. You could write the textbook, teach the course. Have a think first, why would someone do your course? What's useful about your thinking?"

"Let me draw this out first."
"Ok, so it's a way to describe different religions, since all religions can be expressed as a strategy for those three things. I don't know how useful that is... Also, you can just be happy whenever you want. The 'living a good life' kind, not the 'feel good sensations now' kind. It's so easy. We put way more effort into being happy than we should have to, wasting our time going ineffective directions."

"Isn't that what people who study Buddhism learn?"

"Then they're doing a pretty bad job of teaching it. I've gotten this far in life without it, and I just now figured it out in a ten-minute conversation. Also... why aren't you doing what I just described? It's straightforward: first, survive. Second, embark on journeys of figuring out how to survive better. Third, enjoy the "life worth living" happiness - if you're not getting the two kinds of happiness ("feel good sensations now" and "life worth living"), it's a signal that there's something out there for you to figure out. The bigger your sense of self, the easier it is to feel "life worth living" happy. The healthier you are, the easier it is to feel "feel good sensations now" happy. Happiness comes from working on the first two things (survive and explore). So those are good places to look if you're unhappy."

"I'm quite happy as I am."

"Are you? But you're not having the greatest impact you could. I thought we established that at the beginning. Your life could be worthier. How could you be happy picking a path for your life that has less impact than you could? It seems to me that you're pretty healthy and you thought you knew exactly what your 'life worth living' was, but most people don't agree with you. You shouldn't be happy."

"... like I said - naivety and smaller sense of self. Maybe after our chat here, I won't be happy anymore. I've made different bets than you about how to have the greatest impact. It seems my naivety has been shattered in a new way. I have lots to think about. See - I love meeting the people I share the world with. Constant enlightenment. Thank you."

Same answers. I learned nothing new here. It's always worth the effort. More importantly, it's a terribly fun game, messing with monks. They're so willing. So naive. I love when they stumble into new enlightenment from people they believe to be unenlightened, that they're trying to teach.

try Anthony as 50-year-old monk. Make paragraphs a bit more "the essence of what monk is trying to say", only give him his side of the dialogue, has to 
be yourself. you can attempt to say it again if you have a more authentic, "you", way of saying it. Spur of the moment is a pretty high golden standard.

"purpose of existence" flowchart

survive (execute on known methods of survival) -> find purpose (find new methods for "self" to survive longer) -> survive
always, enjoy existence

"how to enjoy existence more" flowchart

not enough 'feel good sensations now' in the recent past? inspect health (physical + mental)
not enough 'life worth living' in the recent past? inspect goals, purposes, behaviour - are purposes/goals aligned with behaviour? Change behaviour or change goals/purpose. Consider whether size of "self" could be bigger.


eastern spiritual enlightenment AND western practicality (scientific method)
scientific spiritual enlightenment
can we have spiritual enlightenment that's measured, proven, and optimized?
or scientific tools held by those pursuing spiritually enlightened directions
both western one god and eastern many gods
utilitarianism with a different optimization objective - survival, where happiness is a side-effect and signal you're on the right track, but not the end-goal.

It doesn't say how you should change your behaviour. Sometimes other people or religions ask you to change your behaviour, and this is a framework for deciding if that behaviour change makes sense. Every religion is a way towards the MVP (to survive). You get to decide which religions are the journey you want to take. There are many ways to evaluate religions against the MVP, and the scientific method is one of them - one with a long history of predictive power.
