Trumpets and streamers. Marching. Joy. Celebration. Victory. 

The next day was a "me" day. I slept, I woke, I ate, I exercised, I read. I spoke to no one - I didn't need to. My purpose had been achieved. That day was the worst day of my life. That day turned into the worst week of my life, which turned into the worst month of my life.

I lost my grip on reality. I talked to a therapist and they said I was going through an existential crisis. My new purpose became to stop having an existential crisis.

I tried the major religions. I found them impractical - they asked for belief. In what? In the unknowable.

I tried the currently popular cults. I found the theology lacking - they were going nowhere that made sense. Completely illogical, but addictive. I joined three of them at the same time. I transparently told them that I was trying out all three. They said such horrible things about each other. Constantly. It became hard to be around such flawed people. The cure for any bad cult is to join competing bad cults. They would tear the other apart for a drop of devotion.

All the people I met in all these places. They're all such great people. They're so right about many things. But the more I ask them about big picture stuff, the fuzzier they get. After I ask enough questions, they say some things are unknowable. I don't buy it.

I met up with a friend in the financial district. We walked past a bank. On the outside it read,

"The purpose of existence is to continue existing. Any combination of ideas is a machine whose purpose is to survive. Come learn about The Minimum Viable Purpose, Mondays and Fridays from bank close until midnight."

Today is Friday. I knew what I was going to do tonight.

I came to the bank at night. A cool wet night, clouds clear after raining. The granite temple. It made no attempt to feel human or welcoming. It didn't need deceptive faux-comfort - it was optimized for its purpose. It was the right place to be.

I walked up to the entrance. As I came closer, I could hear a sound growing stronger. The low blare of a foghorn. It felt ominous, the inevitable. Like, "you've put this off for a long while and it's now time to understand. Come or go - this place isn't going anywhere. You, however, at some point you will know the truth of things. This is inevitable." The sound grew louder, shaking the air around me, until at the entrance it was a piercing pain. I covered my ears but it did not help. If I screamed, no one would hear me. Am I dying? As soon as I walked through the entrance, a "pop" - immediate silence. Was it the lack of foghorn or was it really silent? It didn't matter - the effect was the same. I had made my first enlightened step into the dark.

Darkness with dim lighting to indicate where to be. A blacklist to fill in the gaps. The surfaces, walls, and countertops were spotless. The blacklight highlighted unseen flaws of the distant few people inside. A different perspective that set me a little off-balance. I wasn't used to seeing these flaws. I didn't know how I was supposed to react to seeing these new flaws in other people. I could see vague human figures in the darkness, but no one obvious to talk to. A strip of lights indicated where to go. A queue. I walked past a screen that read, "Dan, please wait in line. Elidad will see you in a few minutes."

There was one person at the till, speaking in hushed tones to the clerk opposite him. The clerk was dressed in a suit - the religious garb of this priest. I could see it in their body language. Confession. Transactional confession. "Forgive me Investor, for I have spent." Funds naked, exposed to both sets of eyes, inspecting the soul of a Capitalist. In exchange for relieving me of the burden of these memories of suboptimal past events, I will make more optimal decisions in the future. More money in my future means more money in yours.

A well-dressed woman walked past and briskly out the door. She was objectively beautiful, but the blacklight revealed invisible lines, making her face disfigured. Her makeup was inconsistently highlighted with flair like an exotic bird. On top of an angular cheekbone, a single tear perched - her only humanizing attribute. Her body language suggested she felt freer, but still shackled - she had been freed into a bigger cage.

Another woman emerged from the shadows. She was average height, relaxed, conservative attire. She demonstrated a socially acceptable degree of wealth and physical beauty for the setting. She wore the Cheshire cat smile of a true believer - like she wanted to both eat me and hug me. The embrace would be her sustenance, I could see she *is* her beliefs. Her smile was her religion licking its lips at this tasty meal of a mind. I'm ready to be food in exchange for the correct purpose.

"Dan, thank you for waiting. Please come in to my office."

Her eyes opened wide then fluttered, like she just had an inspired realization. She turned around and I followed her into the dark. Her office was a wellspring of blacklight. Our flaws were laid bare for the other to see. I was covered in unexpected white flecks. She had many too, especially some lines and spots on her face. I couldn't tell whether they were intentional. They made her that bit more... Present in this space. She sat at her desk, behind the various bank technology implements.

"Please sit."

I sat across from her and absorbed the space. The room was corporate hellscape. It was subtly converted from a place of bureaucratic worship to spiritual processing. Soulless shades of grey, black, and white screaming, "Your brain is here for its computational power. Please suppress feelings, squeeze out every last drop of compute." Like a leafy patch of enlightenment in the belly of the capitalist machine. Faint colour in corporate purgatory. I lost my train of thought imagining a globe of silicon leaves, artificial life floating in endlessly spacious nothingness. What are silicon and carbon, but two elements in this one universe?

"So Dan, this must be your first time here. My name is Elidad. You can call me Dad."

Dan coughed in surprise, then stared for a second.

"I'm not calling you that."

Dad is better than father. Father suggests respect and reverence. Dad is just another deeply flawed human, maybe a few steps ahead. Are those the wrong steps, though? Dad is just another dude making his or her way through life. Dad will tell you when you're screwing things up, but dad is not going to fix your life for you. Dad isn't gambling all-in with your soul, taking a cut if you win, or discarding you if you lose. Dad has life to figure out too, separate from yours.

"I think maybe I should go."

Her eyes went wide again with inspired realization.

"You're uncomfortable. Good. Seeming 'welcoming' is a less effective demeanour for my cause. I am a priestess of Capitalism. This is a temple of Capitalism and in this transactional realm, the way to appear genuine is to curse the ones you love. *Thank you for giving me value*, you say, *but I will never forgive you for the piece of me I had to pay in exchange*. So in this realm, love is debt, more love is more debt. Letting you hate me is the most loving thing I can do for you here.

I want something from you, Dan, I wouldn't be here otherwise. But I will get all I need in the next ten minutes. All I need from you is to ask questions and listen. You will probably never see me again after this conversation. I will be done with you and you won't need me anymore. You'll be free, Dan - you'll owe me nothing and everything. Do you know the difference between a therapist and a spiritual guide, Dan? The therapist asks for payment in cash and the spiritual guide asks for payment in lifeblood. You will leave here believing what I believe, Dan."

Why are you even here then?

"Why *are* we here, Dan? It is a good question. I have the answers."

I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I was raised Christian. I tried religions, I tried cults, and I can't figure out what I want. Nothing feels right. I'm Agnostic, Athiest, I don't know. I just don't have the answers I need.

Islam is great for structure. Did you try that?

A bit, but I don't need more structure in my life.

What about the Buddhists? They're super chill.

Yes. But I kept feeling myself wanting more. They were the closest, but they're missing something. Like two pro sports teams show up to play a game of football, but the referees never say whose side is whose. The teams don't know if they're winning or losing because the refs won't tell them. The one game is fun, but across a season of games, it ends up being kind of meaningless. Not fun. There's more to life than having a bit of fun one game at a time - I want a lifetime of fun.

Their purpose is off.

Yes. And when I ask what their purpose is, they say things like,

"what if there is no purpose?" or "maybe the purpose is not to be known?" or "eliminate human suffering" but I don't buy it. It's all escapism. There's something, I can feel it on the tip of my tongue. There must be something fundamental that binds us all together.

Dan, let me ask you a question. What is the one thing you could not live without? What is the one thing, where if I took it away, you wouldn't be able to continue living?

 Maybe my intelligence? Nah, I'd probably be able to continue living, just maybe less happy. My identity? I guess I'd just live to find some way to reclaim my identity, or I'd make a new one. Maybe my free will and control - I don't want to be a robot with no control.

And what if there was a chance to get your control back?

I guess I could keep living then, yeah.

But you're on the right track. The thing no one can do without is purpose or a way to find new purpose.

Oh, actually, I feel that right now. I had this grand achievement and then I got there. That's why I'm here. Hmm... Is that the purpose of existence? It doesn't sound... complete. I read your slogan - it said something about minimum viable purpose and survival.

You're right. What do you think is The Minimum Viable Purpose? I am its missionary, we all believe in at least two things.

Your slogan said survival. I guess it makes sense.

Right, those are the right words, the right incantations, but there's no magic streaming out because you're missing the meaning. You want a proof? Let's keep it informal. Suppose the purpose of your existence is not to continue existing - it's "anything else". Well, for "anything else" to happen, it needs existence to be there long enough until that happens - right? The purpose of existence is to continue existing, and maybe something more.

Now, you almost have it Dan. You have the two components for the meaning of life: survive and find purpose. Now put them together - here's something to draw on.

I feel like a child.

"You are a baby. This is the mirror." Tabum let out between Elidad's gritted teeth.

Dan scribbled out a diagram. Elidad took it and added some notes.

[image]

Let's go deeper, now. How do you want the purpose of existence to make you feel?

I don't understand. Is it a choice? Happy, I guess. I've heard many people say that the purpose of existence is the pursuit of happiness. Are they wrong?

If you felt happy all the time, would you know what happiness feels like?

Is it because happiness gives them meaning? I guess everyone agrees that happiness is good. I always thought that was weird though, because every time I chase happiness, it never ends up being what I was going for. It's like the pursuit of happiness is a doomed effort.

Exactly. You don't chase happiness - you chase the things that grant you happiness. Happiness is a signal that you're going roughly the right direction, like a compass. If you blindly follow the compass, you'll eventually fall off a cliff or drown or walk in circles forever.

Right. Doing the right things usually makes you happy.

Yes, our bodies are highly-tuned emotion machines. Now, you almost have it Dan. I recommend you add happiness or some similar emotion to make existence more comfortable. 

[image]

Good. You're almost there now. There's one last piece. Who am I to you?

Uhh. Dad?

No, where do I fit into that diagram?

Oh yeah, other people. Love. Is love happiness? Are you happiness? Am I supposed to love you?

"No." She frowned slightly, visibly displeased that he hadn't understood yet. "What things would you consider to be part of your 'sense of self'?"

Hmmm. My body. My cultural background. My nationality. My family. My profession. My hobbies. My friends.

What things do you love?

I see where you're going. I love those things. Those things are part of me. I love me.

Yes - to love something is to consider it part of your "sense of self". And there is no such thing as a selfless act - every single thing you will ever do is for your greater "self". Imagine now, how do you survive the next second?

I don't even have to try.

Right. Now how do you survive the next week?

I guess I have to eat and sleep and drink. And not get killed by anything like... being hit by a vehicle or consuming poison.

Right. Now how do you survive the next 100 years?

Hmmm. Presumably there's a low chance I will survive. I guess I will live through all those things I mentioned earlier. I will live through my family, my community, my nation. All the things I'm contributing to.

How are you going to do that? How are you going to live through them?

I guess I'll contribute to their survival. I will invest in them, to better guarantee their chances of survival.

Exactly, and when you invest in something, you love it more and more. You begin to understand it better and better. You love what you understand. Your "sense of self" is what you understand. Now what about hundreds, or even thousands of years?

I would want my nation and maybe humankind to survive.

And what about eternity? Do you want existence to continue?

I'm not sure.

Well *I* love existence and *I* want it to continue. Perhaps someday you will grow your sense of self until you love all of existence.

Dan scribbled some extra notes.

[image]

Why does any of this matter? How does this change anything?

Do you know the difference between "good" and "evil", Dan? They are relative, so they mean different things to different people. But somehow, we've come to agree on some universal "goods" and "evils" across humankind. What are those relative to? Well Dan, there's a shared moral foundation in the universe. "Good" means "optimal, towards The Minimum Viable Purpose, via whatever other purposes you choose". "Evil" is suboptimal. The Minimum Viable Purpose is the bridge between religion and science. You may even call it the religion of science. The Minimum Viable Purpose is a beacon for every social phenomenon. Morality, justice, ethics, art, economics. They all used to have a purely bottom-up approach. The scientific method is applied bottom-up. Us living things try something out, then collect data about our collective "observations" to determine an optimal path. But now - now, science can be applied top-down too: how to survive? Surely any system has provable milestones for higher-probability survival? Now we can have a generally-agreed-upon, mixed bottom-up/top-down approach to everything.

Dan took a moment to contemplate. Fiddled with the pen.

I'm going to need some time to process. Don't we do this already? I still don't understand why you're here. Why are you in the financial centre and why are you so rude?

This is a conspiracy to make the world a better place. A "good" place. Capitalism is a beautiful idea, but it doesn't want that. And the world today is effectively a Capitalist one. Capitalism would have us burn the world to dust like a swarm of individualistic, self-replicating nanobots. Communism would have us lay collectively bare-backed on an altar to be drained by mosquitos until we become one. Capitalism, socialism, and communism all have deep flaws. We don't yet have the technology for a better societal framework, but we will. If you wanted to change how the world works, how would you do it? You would find the most powerful people, and you would assimilate them. You would find the most powerful organizations, and you would assimilate them too. Who are the most powerful people? There are many across the great industries of humankind, but people in the realm of finance are logical and tortured souls - easy to convert. Finance yields high-performing priests, bishops, and cardinals for The Minimum Viable Purpose.

All of existence is the temple of The Minimum Viable Purpose. It needn't have anything more specific. This bank - a holy temple that lets the common people participate in the religion of Capitalism - is hallowed grounds for The Minimum Viable Purpose. It is not for conversion - that suggests leaving Capitalism behind. The people still have Capitalism, but they have The Minimum Viable Purpose too. Tonight, these are hallowed grounds of *assimilation*.

Now you know The Minimum Viable Purpose. You may choose to change your behaviour or you may not. You may start a sect - but any sect that asks you to change your behaviour is not The Minimum Viable Purpose. You are free to pursue The Minimum Viable Purpose however you like, now with greater understanding. I'm rude because we'll all be better off if you think I'm not a person you should trust. That way, you'll believe in the idea instead of me. You will try to cooperate with me instead of blindly following me. This method doesn't work everywhere, but here at the altar of Capitalism, it is the optimal way to operate.

Why aren't people screaming this on rooftops? Why isn't this visualized everywhere in the world? You just taught me that in ten minutes. Surely that can happen across the world.

Are you so sure that isn't happening now? Perhaps your mind was not open. We have to take iterative care when applying changes, lest those changes bring excessive destruction. Humankind is slowly adjusting to the direction we're going, and there is conflict between those that benefit from the old direction and those that benefit from the new direction. It takes time for new enlightenment to make its way into culture and media. Such is the perpetual cycle of new enlightenment.

After all of this, does anyone turn out different? Am I any different? You just told me what I already believe. I feel just like I did before.

Your mental software is updated now. You've now stepped out of Plato's cave. The whole world will look a little different, but it will be hard to put your finger on how. You only have the words I just gave you to express the new dimension of the same world you saw before. As a side-effect, it's a more complex and meaningful life than the one you used to live. There is no community of The Minimum Viable Purpose except all of existence, no leader except all of existence. You are free. Goodbye Dan.

She stood up expectantly. He stood up concerned. He understood the Minimum Viable Purpose, but now he had more questions than answers. The questions were closer to ground - no longer about the divine. The new questions were about what to do here and now in his remaining lifetime. He was even less certain than he was when he walked in. He still needed a new purpose and religion, but it would be in addition to his existing beliefs, not instead of his existing beliefs. The divine was a solved problem.

---

Before I become omniscient, I want to re-remember one last test for the fun of it. To see if anything has changed yet.

Early in my search, I ran a test with a human monk. I saw his life journey, his every waking moment. From ten years old struggling in a rough backwater, spending his 20s troubled and dangerous - a complex youth. I saw him become enlightened. He chose a simple life of blissful existence. He had everything figured out. By age 50, he was an expert at living life exactly how he believed he should live it.

I knew everything he knew, but I wanted to talk through a problem I had been mulling. I took the form of a troubled human young man, 28 years of age, exactly as the monk imagined himself in his earlier years. A youth just on the edge of realizing his life mistakes, ripe for enlightenment. The monk would be falling over himself to spark that enlightenment - this young man would remember the monk forever as the one who sparked enlightenment. Divine validation, divine satisfaction.

I came to the monk, a dishevelled man. He opened his doors to the public most days in the afternoon, after he had meditated for two hours. No one else was looking for his guidance today - I made sure of it. I peered through the doorway, displaying hesitation.

"Please, come in. It's much cooler in here than out there. Far more comfortable."

"I, I saw you're here to... You can talk through some things?"

"Of course, these office hours are one of my favourite things. I love getting to know the people I share the world with. Come, sit."

I sat across from him. The room was corporate hellscape. It must have been recently converted from a place of beaureacratic worship to spiritual processing. Soulless shades of grey and beige screaming, "Your brain is here for its computational power. Please suppress feelings, squeeze out every last drop of compute." He had covered the worst of it with varied Eastern spiritual decor. Like a leafy patch of enlightenment in the belly of the capitalist machine, faint colour in corporate purgatory. Like a leafy globe of life floating in endlessly spacious nothingness.

"Ok... So I've been thinking these things. It's been pretty hard for me. It's hard for me to say, but.. I'm really not sure about things. I came here to understand. I think if I can answer this one question, I'll know what path I have to take in life. When I think of the happiest people in the world, people who appear happy all the time, I think of monks like you. But few people want to be a monk. So why are monks so happy, and everyone wants to be happy and says things like "the purpose of life is to pursue happiness", but no one wants to be a monk?"

The monk looked through me, silent and non-judging. Waiting for more of my words.

"You are enlightened, right? What does it feel like?"

"Ha. It feels pretty good. It feels like I understand everything. Just about every waking moment, I know what I must do. Mmm. Do you know about flow? Yes. It's like being in flow all the time, like I'm always 'doing' a thing. Even when I'm figuring out what to do next, that's part of 'doing exactly what I must do.'"

"That sounds amazing. See, I'm going through some... changes. Some things came up and want to take a new path in life, and I'm trying to figure out what direction to go [more specific choices]. On one path I could be 'happy" like you and on another path I could be 'important' to the world. Of course I want to be happy, but if I choose that path, I feel like I won't be... doing the 'right' thing, doing something like, *meaningful* you know? I can be happy or I can do something meaningful. If I choose to be happy, I won't really be happy. I'm so confused."

"It's pretty confusing, yes. But it's not a "one or the other" choice. You can be happy and have a whole lot of meaning in your life. You can do very impactful things and live a full, happy life."

"It doesn't feel that way. It feels like if I choose happiness, my life won't feel meaningful, so I won't be happy. If I choose to do really meaningful things, every day will be such a slog - I'll be unhappy the whole time. I have to choose between gluttony and grinding life out, it's either not happy or not happy. How is that a choice? How do I choose?"

"Why not have both? How about grinding through those meaningful things and engorging in gluttony together? You can down that junkfood while you're working. You can binge on media on a treadmill. *laughs* Isn't that a little funny, when we mix it together, they sound like happy things. When you're choosing between the two kinds of suffering you're also choosing between two kinds of happiness."

"Hmmm. I see what you mean. That's comforting. Still, I have to lean more towards one kind of happiness, either the "feel good sensations now" kind of happiness or the "live a life worth living" kind. You said earlier, you feel like you're doing 'exactly the right thing in every waking moment', but how come everyone doesn't want to be a monk? It seems like a shortcut to "feel good sensations now" all the time. Don't you feel bad about meditating all day, like everyone else thinks you could be doing something more useful with your time? So you and everyone else have different priorities. So who is right - everyone else or you?"

"Ha - I used to get up to some pretty terrible things. 'Everyone else' probably thinks meditating all day is a much better option. Anyways, this is about you. I understand. I see what you're saying. I think it will help if... Can you give me an example of a person that everyone else believes is doing exactly the right thing in every waking moment?"

"I guess it's not necessarily successful people... Successful people always seem to do things for themselves first and everyone else second. Well, maybe some successful people think of others first, but not many of them. I guess...  it's the people that choose to do the things that are best for everyone else, to the best of their ability. And they usually have some special skills or missions that others don't have. Like the best teachers that can uniquely inspire students, and get them to learn when other teachers can't. Or nurses that labour tirelessly to heal people. So what can I do? Can you tell me?"

"You have to figure that out for yourself."

"That's not very helpful. What does everyone else care about?"

"I think there's a way to explore this. There are different religions. Different people have different purposes of existence. Different religions have a different 'meaning of life'"

"Yeah but religion is a bit out of fashion. I don't think I want one of those."

"Haha. Do you worship cash? Or idolize a successful artist? Or have a favourite tech or clothing brand? Religions are more common than you think."

"Surely there's some shared direction that we're all going, regardless of religion."

"I hear you. We're all in this together. But everyone has a different religion. Everyone has a different base direction."

"Yeah, but religions always want you to do weird stuff. They want you behave a different way. What I mean is, there must be something that describes the direction we're going, no matter how we behave."

"Maybe some things aren't meant to be known. Maybe it's only for the gods."

"That's an easy out. What if that thing we're all doing is knowable by anyone and easy to describe. What do we know about everything in existence? Well, it exists or it doesn't. Things that exist generally want to continue existing, except for some rare circumstances. Let's look at what the internet says... Here. Wikipedia."

* To realize one's potential and ideals
* To achieve biological perfection
* To seek wisdom and knowledge
* To do good, to do the right thing
* Meanings relating to religion: be with God, go to heaven, etc.
* To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living
* To have power, to be better
* Life has no meaning
* One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life

"So we're going to say it's knowable and it has to apply to everything and every religion. So we can cross out a couple of them."

* To realize one's potential and ideals
* To achieve biological perfection
* To seek wisdom and knowledge
* To do good, to do the right thing
* ~Meanings relating to religion: be with God, go to heaven, etc.~
* To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living
* To have power, to be better
* ~Life has no meaning~
* ~One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life~

"Love?"

"That sounds like a mix of survival and something else - there's some loss-aversion in there. There's certainly some way to describe all these feelings, where more is better. I think happiness is a better word for that."

"Ok, a third thing. I see many words about the same idea: 'realize potential', 'achieve perfection', 'seek knowledge', 'be better'. They're all about growth. So I should survive, grow, be happy. That's what everyone wants me to do."

"I thought you meant that's what everyone is doing. You said you shouldn't have to change your behaviour, right?"

"Right. And so the thing I'm doing now. I'm growing to figure out how to make me and society survive. Hopefully in doing so, it makes me happy. Wow, I feel a lot better already. What do I need to figure out again? What I should be doing with my life. I need to find the greatest impact I can have on making myself last longer."

"Your sense of self seems to encompass many people, and that's a beautiful thing. I can see you doing great things for society."

"Really? I didn't know that. Wait, what does that mean?"

"The way I like to think about it is, different people have different sizes of 'self'. People with bigger senses of self tend to do the things that benefit larger groups of people, even when it's at the cost of their individual single-person self. Yours seems pretty big, if you care about what so many people want from you."

"How come you don't?"

"I guess I'm a bit naive. Maybe I don't have the same powers as you. Maybe I haven't put in the time to grow my sense of self. Who knows."

"So I should place a bet on the best course of action for the group I care about. I should make that happen to the best of my abilities."

"Sounds like a worthy life to me."

"Why hasn't anyone told me this before? It's pretty straightforward, pretty logical. It'd save everyone a lot of time and anguish if people were more upfront about all of this."

"If you find it so simple, I would love to see how you would teach this to others. You could write the textbook, teach the course. Have a think first, why would someone do your course? What's useful about your thinking?"

"Let me draw this out first."
"Ok, so it's a way to describe different religions, since all religions can be expressed as a strategy for those three things. I don't know how useful that is... Also, you can just be happy whenever you want. The 'living a good life' kind, not the 'feel good sensations now' kind. It's so easy. We put way more effort into being happy than we should have to, wasting our time going ineffective directions."

"Isn't that what people who study Buddhism learn?"

"Then they're doing a pretty bad job of teaching it. I've gotten this far in life without it, and I just now figured it out in a ten-minute conversation. Also... why aren't you doing what I just described? It's straightforward: first, survive. Second, embark on journeys of figuring out how to survive better. Third, enjoy the "life worth living" happiness - if you're not getting the two kinds of happiness ("feel good sensations now" and "life worth living"), it's a signal that there's something out there for you to figure out. The bigger your sense of self, the easier it is to feel "life worth living" happy. The healthier you are, the easier it is to feel "feel good sensations now" happy. Happiness comes from working on the first two things (survive and explore). So those are good places to look if you're unhappy."

"I'm quite happy as I am."

"Are you? But you're not having the greatest impact you could. I thought we established that at the beginning. Your life could be worthier. How could you be happy picking a path for your life that has less impact than you could? It seems to me that you're pretty healthy and you thought you knew exactly what your 'life worth living' was, but most people don't agree with you. You shouldn't be happy."

"... like I said - naivety and smaller sense of self. Maybe after our chat here, I won't be happy anymore. I've made different bets than you about how to have the greatest impact. It seems my naivety has been shattered in a new way. I have lots to think about. See - I love meeting the people I share the world with. Constant enlightenment. Thank you."

Same answers. I learned nothing new here. It's always worth the effort. More importantly, it's a terribly fun game, messing with monks. They're so willing. So naive. I love when they stumble into new enlightenment from people they believe to be unenlightened, that they're trying to teach.

try Anthony as 50-year-old monk. Make paragraphs a bit more "the essence of what monk is trying to say", only give him his side of the dialogue, has to 
be yourself. you can attempt to say it again if you have a more authentic, "you", way of saying it. Spur of the moment is a pretty high golden standard.

not enough 'feel good sensations now' in the recent past? inspect health (physical + mental)
not enough 'life worth living' in the recent past? inspect goals, purposes, behaviour - are purposes/goals aligned with behaviour? Change behaviour or change goals/purpose. Consider whether size of "self" could be bigger.

scientific spiritual enlightenment
can we have spiritual enlightenment that's measured, proven, and optimized?
or scientific tools held by those pursuing spiritually enlightened directions
both western one god and eastern many gods
utilitarianism with a different optimization objective - survival, where happiness is a side-effect and signal you're on the right track, but not the end-goal. I don’t know why anyone thought happiness is the right thing to pursue. Everyone knows that when you pursue happiness, you never seem to get what you wanted. It's an emergent signal, not the end-pursuit.

How do you know that's the purpose of existence?

You want a proof? Ok. Let's suppose "anything else" is the purpose of existence. Well, for "anything else" to happen, it needs existence, and existence must continue long enough for "anything else" to happen. So the purpose of existence is to continue existing and maybe more.

For all we know, natural selection could be the basis of all ideas - of mathematics, physics... Their heuristic axioms might now be slightly off. This could shift our whole understanding of reality as we know it.

Experiencing anything predicates continuing to exist until it has the experience. Either we haven’t yet experienced the thing or there is no thing to experience. Either way, continue to exist for now.

Provides certainty and uncertainty. Leaves room for other purposes. Compatible with whatever else you believe. Whatever other purpose you have.

It exists. It has to continue to exist until it fulfils that purpose. So it’s purpose is “exist for long enough to achieve X”. After that, it either gets a new purpose or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t, it can either continue existing or stop existing. If it chooses to stop, its purpose becomes, exist long enough to stop existing.

The purpose of existence is to continue existing, and maybe other things too.

So what!? I just solved religion. I just solved morality. This is *the purpose of existence*. The *meaning of life*.

It sounds a bit meaningless to me.

It doesn't say how you should change your behaviour. Sometimes other people or religions ask you to change your behaviour, and this is a framework for deciding if that behaviour change makes sense. Every religion is a way towards the MVP (to survive). You get to decide which religions are the journey you want to take. There are many ways to evaluate religions against the MVP, and the scientific method is one of them - one with a long history of predictive power.


So you came all this way to ask why no one wants to be me? Why didn't you ask... anyone else?

Well, yes. You're the expert on why someone might not want to be you.

## Key questions

### Must

* Top-down vs. bottom-up
* Two kinds of happiness: in-the-moment vs. existential
* What's the one thing you couldn't do without?
  * Purpose + ability to find new purpose.
  * What if someone took your free will? As long as I maintained my purpose + ability to find new purpose, that'd be ok. Do I still believe I have purpose and I can find new purpose, even if I know they're directing all my actions? (even suspecting I have free will) Things could be horrible, but tolerable.3

### Maybe

* When you dissect a joke, it's not funny anymore. Why are you trying to dissect everything? 
  * Dissecting a joke. Dissecting a romantic relationship. It's all the same - there's some excitement. Excitement is an unexpected quality, that there's a chance for a surprising understanding. You're looking for the surprise. But dissecting isn't "bad" - beauty is understanding the complex system. An unheard joke is exciting, but it isn't beautiful. Understanding the mechanisms that make a joke funny can make that joke beautiful - a piece of art. Of all things, you have to balance the beauty of systematically understanding the thing versus the excitement of surprisingly understanding it. Reward for surprises make us seek out the unexpected until we make sense of it.
