Imagine myself being interviewed and at the start of answering a question or commenting on a topic.

It's like someone just said.

"Something something youth something."

And I'm already one sentence in, riffing off something inspiring to do with the word "youth".

Like,

What are youth for?
Visualize youth in roman times, that they must have been angsty, but hard to grab onto their outlet. I look to past 40 years or so, easy to imagine outlets of youth angst - rock, rap/hip-hop. Imagine older people kinda know how those outlets are flawed, but they allow them because they are deemed "not too disruptive to shut down". Imagine boomers, who are set in their suboptimal ways - yes those ways are pretty optimal for boomers, but not for Gen Y/Z. And those upcoming generations see it so obviously, like someone joining a new company who sees all the horrible flaws in processes that long-time employees have become accustomed to. The angst is an expression of how suboptimal some things obviously are (things that are important to youth), which those "in charge" are clearly not prioritizing.
