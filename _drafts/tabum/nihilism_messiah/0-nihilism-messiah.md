# Nihilism messiah

## Nihilism
*There is no purpose to existence.*

Horror buildup with lullaby comforting nihilist philosophy.

## Nihilist theism
*God fills the gaps in the universe where technology could be.*
*The compass of technological progress points towards god.*

God the joker. God is humourous because god occupies the gap between perceived reality and reality. Gods jokes are to make us do silly things that we think god wants, but doesn't really care about. A technological gap. When we finally advance tech and see the difference, it is humorous.

Previously unfunny nihilism messiah learns humour.

Conclusion: Many gods is a symptom, like the many greek/roman gods. Nihilism is a symptom of technological hole, but only nihilists realize, but then they don't care enough to do anything about it. That there is something beyond formal logic that we don't yet have the technology for. Need a new method, like the scientific method, for appropriating this new technology. Find it by keeping mind open while on the cutting-edge of research. (we're hitting the boundaries of physics x philosophy, need new models - is our conception of the boundaries of existence too bounded, using infinity and recursion? need another concept? beyond infinity, reframing infinity so it's no longer a problem. Infinity-based model of the universe & language & mental model.)

Another book: Nihilism Messiah. Purpose is to do nothing. Killing self is doing too much. Eventually deteriorate naturally. Can’t transmit the religion to others because true believers perish before they can. Messiah remembers everything except for last key piece of information that prevents him from choosing to move no longer. Digitally recorded for the first time, so message survives.

True believers don’t suicide. True balance is just beyond suicide.

Nihilism god is proof of multiple gods (along with tabum and abrahamic). Parallel to Greek gods. Explain many gods are a signal that we are short of technology that will move all-powerful god back beyond creation.

What does Nihilism god want us to do? Just exist. Killing self is a high-effort action, same with reaching out to believers. Believers have to find nihilism god on their own, but can't share afterwards. A non-spreading religion, like a religion about death.

True nihilists meditate like crazy. Like most intense monks. Buddhism is the most nihilist philosophy.

Prophets of existentialism: existential philosophers like nitsche

Worship things that don’t exist yet. New people, new ideas, etc. We only worship past and present ideas. Promise of new ideas. (Which is religion)

Worship things that are perfectly understood. (What are you even worshiping?)

Prayer joke. It's a very valuable thing. But it's not for the god. It's for the people - regular meditation is very good for people.

## Delegator God

Image of human figure in meditative sitting position, observing everything happening below and making targeted interventions without even moving. Endless platforms above human figure of the same human figure. But you can't really see above the next level up. Current level is half-delegated.

Order:
* cells: god brings food
* monkeys: god creates each baby
* early humans: god controls weather and sun
  * arts
  * healing
  * fate, wisdom
  * death
  * animals and forests
* telling people what to do: thought he delegated that to scientific method+darwin, but resistance to latest delegation. Of course the new guy isn't perfect, but he'll end up doing an even better job than me - he can specialize.
* currently residing on infinity

Our father the labourer-in-spirit. Not all-powerful, just desperately trying to keep the spiritual part of the ship running. Controls the space between things and provides technology. He keeps inventing strange things for us to discover in the space between things. He’s a very busy one, but makes time for us. Many of his inventions are strange. Something we don’t understand? Good is hand-cranking until we perform enough scientific prayer to mine that information.

parable of "god is the variable x in the formula x = 1 + 1" (god is the yet unknown technology)

Two sets of simulations with roughly the same starting conditions. One progresses by encountering the bounds of the universe, and those bounds are only extended by "simulator god" when they look deeper. The other progresses by encountering the same bounds, but everything is set up already from the endpoint of the freestyled rule creation, so not subject to shortcomings of a "simulator god" making things up on the spot. Compare how the species evolves over time.

Explain Dan's universe-resetting in this story.


"What's their biology god-level?"

"Uhhh still at birth god-level. They haven't figured out pregnancy science yet."

"The what?"

"God-level is the level of technological advancement in a given domain. A species fills in the gaps of their understanding of the universe with an all-powerful being - their chosen god or gods. Like, when children don't understand where babies come from, they think that 'the adults' make babies happen. Adult society is god. If 'the adults' don't understand where babies come from, then the adults will say that babies come from God. Once the adults achieve technological advancement to learn where babies really come from, they give God different powers to fill in the new gaps in understanding."

"What about atheists?"

"Everyone has gap-filling-god because no one understands the universe perfectly. Everyone needs to fill the gaps in their understanding with something. That something is the gap-filling-god. Athiests believe there is no deity - no personal supreme being who is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent, caring about  humans and human affairs. Athiests have a different word for god. To them, god is science or chaos or 'the stuff I don't understand yet' or whatever."

What's our god-level?

"We're stuck on infinity in most domains. We understand straight lines and loops, but not when they go on forever. So when we see infinity starting to happen, we think, 'that is god's doing'. Infinity seems to have all-powerful properties that we don't understand. Like, infinity appears to be all around us, but what creates infinity? Usually when this happens, we find that we're asking the wrong questions."

Our reality is formal logic, because that’s how our brains work. If something can’t be modelled by current formal logic, we literally can’t understand it. We have to evolve a new mechanism to understand.

Our creator may not be not causal, may not fit into formal logic. Or our creator is based on emergent phenomenon that can be derived from formal logic, which we may not yet have figured out.

The belief system is where you point all the unknown implications of unexplainable data given your current formal logic system, to.

Under what social conditions would it be ok for humankind to choose not to exist any longer? Compare to old person who tries to be useful but eventually gets a bit too tired.

Cover is vantablack. Same with outside of pages. No title or title is black. Locked closed? Randomly have many blank pages in a row, very long stretch at beginning. Because god is the space/gaps. Make it as if there should be pages of critical information there.

Each book is different. Different ordering of chapters, different pieces left out, different blank page amounts.

Other religions would know that feeling like having no purpose makes humans suicidal. Other religions fix human condition for nihilists.

It's the feeling that there is no purpose that is unbearable, not the reality of it. The reality says, do whatever is automatic - sit in the back seat.

## Benevolent God died for our sins

Funeral for (Abrahamic) god as an annual festival. Funeral because you want to remember good and bad things about a dead idea. Respectful, no false depictions.

“Benevolent god died for our sins. We were becoming too righteous. Gave his life to let us live on.” Because good vs evil dichotomy fundamentally wrong. Satan died for our sins too.

Chapter with three perspectives:
- Human
- Society
- Other gods at his funeral.

Dedicated to benevolent god - may he RIP.

Pick a day, describe what happens on that day to commemorate. Describe in a way that others can actually turn it into a festival.

Limits

Ocean, earth, universe, multiverse.

Each time, we callled it existence, and marvelled at the boundaries.

What cardinality of infinity of existence will we uncover? What rate of enlightenment will we achieve?

---

religions are where you find the boundaries of the unknown, where beliefs must exist to operate in the world, and you make up stories about how that came to be
