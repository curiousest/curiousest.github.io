other kind of relationship:
- never have sex with your primary partner
- committed to them
- have sex with other people

Dude wrote “What AIs love?”. Starts a truth-providing company to push a post-capitalist pattern. Finance and startup talk is in the style of smut (because that stuff feels good but is dirty). Make it cool so it can become uncool/understood/nbd.

have to pick between her (representing chill and love life) and going way too far with stuff (representing survive). Don't have to - optimal way is to teach everyone so that we're aware of these crazy things and do something balanced about them.

main thesis is to prop up the establishment, which are important institutions we have to take care of - not rethink everything. Make small changes.


One relationship - committed but not sleeping together, then immaculate conception.

Another relationship: two straight dudes. Incels. Show how any of their relationships are toxic because of personal character flaws. Rob as inspiration?

Establish the practice in schools between pairs in a completely non-sexual and unsexualized manner "best friends".

When people want to be serious, they stop having sex. Most relationships disintegrate pretty quickly, especially at earlier ages. People still transition between partners as they grow up.

Another lesson: rules about sex aren't one-size-fits-all. Monogamy-oriented people struggle in this environment. Poly people struggle in the monogamy environment. Both ways of thinking are delusional.

End of story make religion for monogamy.

Priest who says, "you'd deprive me of sex, want me to starve?"

Scientists say both are ok, and what really matters is stability. (Which is the moral lesson)

Goes too far and it's a tragedy. 1-1 love is not the answer.

Cultivate diversity of faith.

Mono-commitment poly-sexual relationship. Mono-poly. Playing monopoly.

Two straight white guys are heavily discriminated against/frowned-upon because they're a threat to the system. The system is used to M-F same-race, where they sleep together until they don't. People never sleeping together is an emerging concept and two successful straight guys feels like some to be ruining the system. Conservative coloured women in traditional M-F relationships especially vocal about it being unfair.

Conservatives ancient tradition: stop sex after first child. For purpose of population control.

Lots of exploration of sex. And imagery, feelings, etc. But use new words and social situations to express all the things, as a code, so it doesn't sound sexual. Maybe the entity one level more abstract (company or family or something) feels all the things, so entity one higher level is sexualised. Use embeddings of what those things feel like.

Main character abstains from sex due to his conflict with different belief systems, but abstract entities are crazy exploratory.

Things like making a contract with another party, entirely at your company's mercy. Each time they close a deal, cash inflow (orgasm) for them and a little tiny bit for you. But you're building up yours, and have a gigantic release of a different genre, like IPO or something.
