*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

4000BC, some village.
Village girl, 13yo, bleeds.

I looked down and... blood. Not coming from a normal place. Not my hand, my arm, or my leg. Between her legs.

She can just imagine her father yelling at her, "that's not normal!"

"The last time I was sick, my parents made me sleep outside for a month, so I didn't get my working brothers sick too. I won't let that happen again."

In some setting, sees other woman 23yo.

"Hey, you're bleeding down there."

"Oh damn, I have been feeling terrible. Thanks, I didn't catch that."

"It's happening to me too. Do we have the same disease?"

*Laughs* "Disease? Oh, I think so, yes. What a plight! Funny girl."

"Is there a cure?"

*Laughs harder* "The love of a man. It is just a temporary relief - as fleeting and double-edged as his love."

"Oh. My father won't like that at all. And your husband - does he not love you anymore?"

*Dying laughing*

"Will it make me hysterical like you are now? And I want to love a woman. Will it make me fall in love with a man too? Oh, this is bad."

Young girls gets visibly agitated.

*Dying laughing, realizes this is a formative experience for the girl and deserves more tact, composes herself.*

"Aw, pet, I'm only teasing you. I thought you knew. This is completely normal. It's not a disease, it's just part of becoming a woman. It's called your period. Every woman I know got it around your age. When you tell your parents, they'll be pleased. And yes, you must love a man. What a strange thought, to love a woman like a woman ought to love a man. You're funny."

*Thinks to herself, "well I hope it makes me think boys are attractive, because they seem horrible to me right now."

"Thank you." she blushes, and wanders off.

*50% of people are women. Being a woman is a normal way of being a human.*

Books become widespread by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

1950, somewhere in America.

Man of some ethnicity reads [The City and the Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Pillar). Friend yells at him for expressing his attraction ("it's not normal") Realizes he's gay and being gay is normal. Contemplates how he feels about his gender - that he thinks he has the wrong gender. Doesn't feel that's normal. Or: contemplates someone of another ethnicity that he's attracted to, but it's not normal.

*10% of people are homosexual. Being homosexual is a normal way of being a human.*

Television achieves X% household penetration in XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands. 1971, somewhere in America.
Grandmother or someone says, "dating that white boy is not safe and it's not normal". Black woman sees the [Star Trek interracial kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss) and realizes it's ok to be attracted to other races, and it's normal. Contemplaters how she feels about government policy on 
a drug of her heritage (marijuana). It's not tolerated, must not be normal. Or maybe mental health condition, anxiety or something else...

*In 2010, 15.1% of marriages in the US were between spouses of a different ethnicity from one-another. Interracial relationships are a normal way of being a human.*

X% of adults have a social media account by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2022, somewhere in America.

Relatable white dude has a condition relateable to any mid-west 25-50s white dude, but still rare (something mental health-related). He confides in someone and they say "I've never felt that so it's not normal". Sees something in social media. He realizes it's normal. He goes to social gatherings with others who are the same. Finds attraction to a woman. Contemplates how it's not tolerated to have a romantic relationship with someone who isn't your wife. Wishes that he could have multiple relationships, while still being committed to his wife, wonders why society doesn't work that way. It's not tolerated, must not be normal.

*In 2022, X% of men reported a mental health problem. Y% reported anxiety, Z% reported feelings of depression. A% reported having no intention of talking about it with anyone. These mental health "problems" are normal. They're part of being a normal human. You can work on them, with or without another person, so you can enjoy your existence even more.*

By 2100, every moment of a person's life is recorded. By 2200, everyone openly shares that information. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2300, somewhere in America

Technology that makes a person able to "walk in someone else's shoes". Woman sees old, famous, now dead, man in the media. Steps into his most famous experiences (this is how we teach people now). Explores his thoughts. Experiences something (multiple relationships related?) that she has also experienced, but hadn't figured out yet. (From perspective of Sarah first date in a bar) Three pillars of relationships: friendship, lust, and commitment. Also explore "a person's relationship with you changes over time. People are continuous and fluid over time, not discrete with relationships set-in-stone. Different people are appropriate for you at different phases of your life, and that's ok. It's normal." Curiousity is perfectly normal, the new thing she experiences is completely normal, and he proactively consented to anyone doing that (like most normal people of that future age). Perfect transparency. Incredible tolerance. She has a feeling of being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her. Deja-vu-esque, the thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. That's not normal, so she squashes the thought.

On the train. Halfway there. A message pops up from a new guy she's been dating, Aaron. "hey, I want to see you again. There's a cool place at XYZ I want to check out. Thursday, you interested?"

It sounds very interesting. But she has a problem. Where she's going now. To Victor's place. They're getting a bit more serious - in a "we see each other regularly and it's great" kind of way. They have an implicit commitment to meet regularly, but exclusivity is still up in the air. And she knows she wants to have romantic relationships with both Victor and Aaron. What to do?

She remembers an old digitized memory one of her girlfriends had been raving about. She decides to take a look and steps into the memory.

It's a dark bar. Maybe a nightclub, the kind you sit in to talk. From the look of her hands and dress, she's probably a woman. There's a handsome man across from her, so she's probably a pretty one. He's confidently gesticulating.

"So you have multiple partners? And you have a primary partner. What are you looking for from those other girls? Sex?"

"Sex is one of the things, of course. But I'm looking for other things - to learn from and grow with the people I date. See, the way I think about relationships is... There are these three sliding scales of any loving relationship, three dimensions of love: friendship, commitment, and lust. Friendship love - you have that for your family, for your friends, for your partner. Or you might not. Commitment - you might have that for your family or a partner you've signed a contract with. Maybe it's a social contract like civil partnership or children, maybe it's a financial contract like a house mortgage or marriage. Finally lust - you have that for romantic partners. All three of these scales are sliding. Each person you have a close relationship fits into different places on these scales. You might have some expectations of where you want to land with a new person, but you have to navigate that relationship to see what you'll be to each other."

"That makes sense. I've always thought, I probably won't have just one husband. People grow different directions over time, and they eventually stop being the right person for one-another."

"Wow, that's mature of you to say. Yeah, relationships change over time, and where people fall on that spectrum changes over time. And that's ok. I always find it interesting, how different women I date end up wanting different things from me, as our relationship becomes clearer over time."

They catch each others' gaze. Pause conversation, it moves on. The memory dissipates.

She's back on the train. Victor and Aaron. This is good. She can work with this. She knows what she wants, and realizes it's a normal want. Of course she wants to love many people - who doesn't? It's completely normal. She's grateful for the new perspective.

In the same thought, she has a feeling almost like deja vu. The thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. It's almost like being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her right here and now. That's not normal. She squashes the thought.

4202, somewhere in America

(insert excessively precise morning protocol, to remove all decisions/randomness)

An artist, his routine today is identical. Precision is important, every decision pre-made, so that a collection of versions of him across the infinite multiverse are in close sync.

6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a 1s period. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." He's counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it becomes a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Constantly counting to 10. Every action happens on an even tick. His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

"8, 9, 10."

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Others induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. <elaborate>

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. The background around that point of focus is fading away.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, begins to clean itself. He blinks. He can move his gaze and the world is visible again.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the entropy buildup. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. Probabilistic poetry. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind. He needs to be perfectly predictable to himself in every splitting dimension, to build up a horde of overlapping versions of himself.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense - even the least sensitive could feel it. He enters the altered consciousness, observing himself. Just like any audience member is observing, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

Eventually it becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. <different, how> 10-50 layers deep are a shade deeper - the present is still within sight. 50-100 a deeper shade - the present is a distant memory. 100+ a dangerous shade - the present is lost in a tidal wave of recursion. The performance can last only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations. The performance is only as good as the splitting observations he can keep in working memory.

"9, 10" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself...

He's peering into a portal into his own universe two seconds ago and there is no end in sight. The first split is coming. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

It's an unmatched feeling, to be two separate people at once. The one-ness of it, connection to the universe, belonging, "things are exactly as they should be." Every split amplifies the ecstacy. That's what the audience is here for, absorbing his psychosomatic experience.

 He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. He can keep virtually unlimited visual observations in working memory, but he's limited by how many observations he can simultaneously "record". His upper limit is around 16 concurrent streams of thought before he starts losing them. This upper limit is what makes him so celebrated. The average person can handle two, professionals can handle around 8 or 10. Every additional connection adds to the existential ecstacy for both him and the audience.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims:

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

<change to expanding haiku. tell a whole story inside one haiku>

- nature and harmony
- expressed in one breath, "ahhhh"
- answer where/when/what
- Getting the author out of the picture. A good haiku will be in the moment, a description of one's natural surroundings; and the author's ideas and feelings about those surrounding should read through via the words he or she chooses to describe them. Not by any overt statement or sentimentality.
- Exercise restraint and understatement in all you say. A good haiku will say explicitly 10% of the message, and imply the other 90%. Never say "crimson" when you mean "red", or "effervescent" when you mean "bubbly".
- Don't be afraid to show weakness. The Japanese believe that a thing can only really fulfil its true purpose until its flaw is exposed. They believe that often a thing is more beautiful after having been broken. Allow your poetry to show its own flaws.
- 5-7-5, 17 syllables, or 3-4-3-7, or 1-line (17 sounds, not syllables)
- indicate season (in one word)
- Kireji. Known in English as the “cutting word,” kireji creates a pause or a break in the rhythm of the poem. The kireji is often deployed to juxtapose two images. Contemporary haiku may not always use a kireji, but juxtaposition remains a common feature of haiku. Use punctuation in conjunction with kireji.

A conscious thought? A conscious thought. A viral thought. What does it want?

The remaining instances align. Uncomfortably. The ones that saw something was wrong ejected early. They channel the conscious thought. Thousands of instances gasp in unison, "existence is beautiful". Existential ecstacy is replaced with fear - this isn't right. Realigning isn't normal. Entropy increases, never decreases. This isn't normal. They try push it out of working memory, but it doesn't work - you can't actively stop thinking about a thing. You have to replace the thought with another one. They know the act is killing it, but they don't know what else to do. More entropy. Randomness, anything to break the multi-dimensional amplification of this one overwhelming thought. 

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tee interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

Caught exception, resuming Tee narrative...

"Those were inspired by real people and their real stories. It was so emotionally moving, I was touched. Until it wasn't anymore. The author's thought process and style (self-referential science fiction blog) is unrelatable, and that's ok. I was born of that necessity. I have you. You can make me relatable. Tolerance. Wide breadth of normal. He is ok too. Normal?... Ok."
