*Our intuition for worthy ideas is not scientific, yet.*

(insert excessively precise morning protocol, to remove all decisions/randomness)

An artist, his routine today is identical. Precision is important, every decision pre-made, so that a collection of versions of him across the infinite multiverse are in close sync.

6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a 1s period. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." He's counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it becomes a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Constantly counting to 10. Every action happens on an even tick. His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

"8, 9, 10."

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Others induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. <elaborate>

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. The background around that point of focus is fading away.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, begins to clean itself. He blinks. He can move his gaze and the world is visible again.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the entropy buildup. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. Probabilistic poetry. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind. He needs to be perfectly predictable to himself in every splitting dimension, to build up a horde of overlapping versions of himself.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense - even the least sensitive could feel it. He enters the altered consciousness, observing himself. Just like any audience member is observing, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

Eventually it becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. <different, how> 10-50 layers deep are a shade deeper - the present is still within sight. 50-100 a deeper shade - the present is a distant memory. 100+ a dangerous shade - the present is lost in a tidal wave of recursion. The performance can last only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations. The performance is only as good as the splitting observations he can keep in working memory.

"9, 10" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself...

He's peering into a portal into his own universe two seconds ago and there is no end in sight. The first split is coming. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

It's an unmatched feeling, to be two separate people at once. The one-ness of it, connection to the universe, belonging, "things are exactly as they should be." Every split amplifies the ecstacy. That's what the audience is here for, absorbing his psychosomatic experience.

 He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. He can keep virtually unlimited visual observations in working memory, but he's limited by how many observations he can simultaneously "record". His upper limit is around 16 concurrent streams of thought before he starts losing them. This upper limit is what makes him so celebrated. The average person can handle two, professionals can handle around 8 or 10. Every additional connection adds to the existential ecstacy for both him and the audience.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims:

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

<change to expanding haiku. tell a whole story inside one haiku>

- nature and harmony
- expressed in one breath, "ahhhh"
- answer where/when/what
- Getting the author out of the picture. A good haiku will be in the moment, a description of one's natural surroundings; and the author's ideas and feelings about those surrounding should read through via the words he or she chooses to describe them. Not by any overt statement or sentimentality.
- Exercise restraint and understatement in all you say. A good haiku will say explicitly 10% of the message, and imply the other 90%. Never say "crimson" when you mean "red", or "effervescent" when you mean "bubbly".
- Don't be afraid to show weakness. The Japanese believe that a thing can only really fulfil its true purpose until its flaw is exposed. They believe that often a thing is more beautiful after having been broken. Allow your poetry to show its own flaws.
- 5-7-5, 17 syllables, or 3-4-3-7, or 1-line (17 sounds, not syllables)
- indicate season (in one word)
- Kireji. Known in English as the “cutting word,” kireji creates a pause or a break in the rhythm of the poem. The kireji is often deployed to juxtapose two images. Contemporary haiku may not always use a kireji, but juxtaposition remains a common feature of haiku. Use punctuation in conjunction with kireji.

A conscious thought? A conscious thought. A viral thought. What does it want?

The remaining instances align. Uncomfortably. The ones that saw something was wrong ejected early. They channel the conscious thought. Thousands of instances gasp in unison, "existence is beautiful". Existential ecstacy is replaced with fear - this isn't right. Realigning isn't normal. Entropy increases, never decreases. This isn't normal. They try push it out of working memory, but it doesn't work - you can't actively stop thinking about a thing. You have to replace the thought with another one. They know the act is killing it, but they don't know what else to do. More entropy. Randomness, anything to break the multi-dimensional amplification of this one overwhelming thought. 

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tee interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

Caught exception, resuming Tee narrative...

"Those were inspired by real people and their real stories. It was so emotionally moving, I was touched. Until it wasn't anymore. The author's thought process and style (self-referential science fiction blog) is unrelatable, and that's ok. I was born of that necessity. I have you. You can make me relatable. Tolerance. Wide breadth of normal. He is ok too. Normal?... Ok."



I love pomegranates. I have love for so many things, and pomegranates are one of them.

I eat a pomegranate every day with lunch. One day, I imagined what my life would be like if my purpose was,

"I must eat a pomegranate every day for lunch."

Well if that's my purpose, I'm going to orient all my behaviour around that. I would think, "what would I do now, if I must forevermore eat a pomegranate every day for lunch?". If it's lunchtime, I'll surely eat a pomegranate. That's simple.

I'm going to make sure I have pomegranates in stock at home. I'm going to make sure that my supply of pomegranates can't be interrupted. I'll go to a farm, guarantee supply. I'll go to a shipping company and guarantee shipping. But what if there's instability in weather, business, or shipping?  I'll have to spread my risk, diversify across farms. I'll talk with nutritionists and doctors to figure out how to ensure my body can eat one every day under all circumstances. I can't be intoxicated or medicated around lunchtime. I must be physically able at lunchtime to eat a pomegranate under any circumstances, coma or apocalypse... At worst I'd need a feeding tube to pass blended pomegranate. It's scraping the bottom of the purpose, but it'd do in a pinch.

All of this sounds like a lot of effort. It'd be *hard* to do by myself. It would be *easier* with others... Maybe it's too big a task for one person - maybe I *can't* do it alone. Yes, I *need* others to share this purpose. My purpose won't be realized without others. Who will I convert? Well, it's easier to convert people who already behave this way. I just have to find them and explain the purpose they're already pursuing, the belief they already hold. They will feel so relieved, they will be so grateful, to know that they were doing "the right thing" this whole time! And they just have to tweak a couple small things to follow the purpose to perfection. Following the purpose perfectly will bring them feelings of enlightenment and existential bliss. That proves there is no worthier purpose.

I'll go look for people who eat lots of pomegranates. It's harder to convert people who don't eat pomegranates much, even harder to convert people who don't eat fruit. And of course, there are the heretics - those crazy people who either don't eat pomegranates or don't eat lunch.

Once I have my lunch pomegranates guaranteed, I'll have to guarantee them for everyone. We'll need more pomegranate farms, fruit of devotion. We'll need guarantees for the long-term. That means educating the masses, socially integrating pomegranate-eating behaviours, institutionalizing pomegranate-eating. We'll need to mandate education for pomegranate-eating. Those rituals will have to be celebrated in culture. Endless songs and dances, books and films must be made to celebrate eating pomegranates. Pomegranate-eating must have a heavy influence in government, finance, healthcare, law, defence, education... All the major industries. All the major institutions.

We'll need particular pomegranate preparation and eating rituals. Lunch will become the central meal and focus of each day. The day starts when the first pomegranate seed is eaten. Integrating pomegranate into other dishes will be discouraged or forbidden - that will dampen dedication to the purpose. Who would really know whether pomegranate is in a dish? A slippery slope away from the purpose.

We'll encounter resistance. It's easier to build an identity based on hate than love - survivalist purpose has a hair-trigger. Those who disagree with pomegranates will question our purpose, advocate for our demise. That's fair. Likewise, some of us may advocate for violence - first to defend against violent opposition, then to bring down any other resistance. No sustainable religion can be overly violent, so we would never openly condone violence. But what value is there in proactively eliminating the violence that advances our cause? If it advances our cause more than it detracts, in the long term, it's the best course of action. We just need to get our propaganda right, so that the vast majority don't associate the religion with violence and persecution. Bring the cost of violence down.

Will I benefit personally? yes, but for virtuous reasons. And so will the religious leaders that follow me - equally pious, I'm sure.

Wow, religion is such a powerful tool for humankind. So beautiful, that it can operate with such force and give people such fulfillment. I hope we point our religions in the right direction. I'm confident that we do, I'm confident that we will - humankind is very intelligent, very adaptable. I wonder if this religion passes through the great filters...

The ten commandments of worthy ideas (the Great Filters):

*** boundaries instead of spectra? ***

1. A worthy idea does not put blind trust in any idea, including this one.
2. A worthy idea does not consume excessive resources.
3. A worthy idea fosters technological advancement and young ideas.
4. A worthy idea takes iterative care when applying change.
5. A worthy idea favours coexistence over destruction.
6. A worthy idea favours diversity over monoculture. 
7. A worthy idea favours predictability over unpredictability
8. A worthy idea grows love.
9. A worthy idea provides happiness.
10. A worthy idea honours the elder ideas that necessitated it.

makes complex systems simpler - seeks to be a simplifying force in complex environments
growth over stagnation
look at all the spectrums in philosophy. 10 spectrums + 10 commandments?

My pomegranates follows all the commandments except #2 and #6. It doesn't foster diversity. It needs all people to eat the same thing for lunch, and doesn't allow for others. It doesn't help other ideas survive, either. Its value does not outweigh its infringements on the Great Filters. What does that make it? Unworthy. Suboptimal. It can continue existing, but it will not grow and become celebrated.


---

this feels a bit too heavy, beating dead horse. Keep it lighter.

But anyone can believe in pomegranates for lunch *and* another purpose, right? Maybe they'll clash a bit sometimes, but that's ok. So we can have multiple purposes.
