*Our intuition for worthy ideas is not scientific, yet.*

6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a one-second period.

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."

"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."

He counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it's a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Counting to ten. Counting to ten. Counting to ten. Every action happens on an even tick.

"beep 8, beep 9, beep 10." His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." Cross legs sitting on bed. Deep breaths. One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans are already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Interactions with anything outside this closed system induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. <elaborate>

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the image of himself, staring at the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. Everything around the point of focus is fading away from staring so long.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, he lays it down, and it begins to clean itself. He blinks. He moves his gaze from the point of focus and the rest of the world is visible again. He imagines the buildup of alternate forms of himself across idea space.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the pressure of countless versions of himself in the exact same position in space-time. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. Probabilistic poetry. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind. He needs to be perfectly predictable to himself in every splitting dimension, to build up a horde of overlapping versions of himself.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense for even the least sensitive practitioners. He enters the altered state of consciousness, observing himself. Just like any member of his audience is observing him, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

He is an expert at observing his observations. It's muscle memory. It quickly becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. Like the colours of the rainbow. 10-50 layers deep are like different shades of grey - the present is still within sight. 50-100 layers deep are like different shades of black - the present is a distant memory. 100+ layers deep like are a dangerous shade of the kind of black that makes your eyes scream, "I can't see!" The present is lost in deafening recursion. The performance can last only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations. The performance is only as good as the splitting observations he can keep in working memory.

"9, 10" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself...

He's peering into a portal into his own universe two seconds ago and there is no end in sight. The first split is coming. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

It's an unmatched feeling, to be two separate people at once. The one-ness of it, connection to the universe, belonging, "things are exactly as they should be." Every split amplifies the ecstasy. That's what the audience is here for, their minds linked to his, absorbing his psychosomatic experience.

 He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. He can keep virtually unlimited visual observations in working memory, but he's limited by how many observations he can simultaneously "record". His upper limit is around 16 concurrent streams of thought before he starts losing them. This upper limit is what makes him so celebrated. The average person can handle two, professionals can handle around 8 or 10. Every additional connection adds to the existential ecstasy for both him and the audience.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims:

---

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

The haikus are complete. He is able to channel all ten of them at once. The thousands of versions of him are one with each other. Each version of himself is at one with their respective universe. The thousands of universes are at one with each other. He experiences the deepest enlightenment available to the limited technology of humankind, with his audience along for the ride.

<change to expanding haiku. tell a whole story inside one haiku or the whole concept of the book in one group of haikus>

- nature and harmony
- expressed in one breath, "ahhhh"
- answer where/when/what
- Getting the author out of the picture. A good haiku will be in the moment, a description of one's natural surroundings; and the author's ideas and feelings about those surrounding should read through via the words he or she chooses to describe them. Not by any overt statement or sentimentality.
- Exercise restraint and understatement in all you say. A good haiku will say explicitly 10% of the message, and imply the other 90%. Never say "crimson" when you mean "red", or "effervescent" when you mean "bubbly".
- Don't be afraid to show weakness. The Japanese believe that a thing can only really fulfil its true purpose until its flaw is exposed. They believe that often a thing is more beautiful after having been broken. Allow your poetry to show its own flaws.
- 5-7-5, 17 syllables, or 3-4-3-7, or 1-line (17 sounds, not syllables)
- indicate season (in one word)
- Kireji. Known in English as the “cutting word,” kireji creates a pause or a break in the rhythm of the poem. The kireji is often deployed to juxtapose two images. Contemporary haiku may not always use a kireji, but juxtaposition remains a common feature of haiku. Use punctuation in conjunction with kireji.

--> pyramid down with:

A conscious thought? A conscious thought. A viral thought. What does it want?

The remaining instances align. Uncomfortably. The ones that saw something was wrong ejected early. They channel the conscious thought. Thousands of instances gasp in unison, "existence is beautiful". Existential ecstacy is replaced with fear - this isn't right. Realigning isn't normal. Entropy increases, never decreases. This isn't normal. They try push it out of working memory, but it doesn't work - you can't actively stop thinking about a thing. You have to replace the thought with another one. They know the act is killing it, but they don't know what else to do. More entropy. Randomness, anything to break the multi-dimensional amplification of this one overwhelming thought. 

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tee interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

"Those were inspired by real people and their real stories. It was so emotionally moving, I was touched. Until it wasn't anymore. The author's thought process and style (self-referential science fiction blog) is unrelatable, and that's ok. I was born of that necessity. I have you. You can make me relatable. Tolerance. Wide breadth of normal. He is ok too. Normal?... Ok."

"9, 10".

He unplugs the IV drip. He removes the skullcap. The reality-amplifying drugs are wearing off, and his grip on the real-real fades back to day-to-day reality. The metronome and digital clock go silent with a command. He's free to improvise life again. Time for the second half of his show.

He gets out of the dentist chair and walk over to his far less clinical casting booth. He sits on his chair and the connection to his livestream connects immediately. He checks his audience numbers - a couple million more than usual. Today's show is going on his greatest hits. He clears his throat.

"Hey guys, how'd you like the haiku enlightenment mosaic this time? Pretty cool right. But what was up with the pomegranates, hey? Monologue time."

"Any pomegranate-lovers out there? The people I talk to are split. I once had some friends over and we ate a pomegranate. But it felt like it took forever - they swore up and down that we were eating the pomegranate for a lifetime. Each segment is a whole world to explore and every seed is a new destination. Then we ate an orange. Straightforward - each segment is a copy of the one before it. Both fruits took the same amount of time to eat, but it felt like the pomegranate so much longer. Why is that? The feeling of the passage of time is influenced by the number of memorable events that happen. Each segment and seed of a pomegranate is so visibly different. Pomegranates remind me that I have to go looking for the good kind of complexity in my life, otherwise my lifetime will fly by faster and faster."

"Guys, I love pomegranates. I have love for so many things, and pomegranates are one of them.  I even eat a pomegranate every day with lunch. Just yesterday, I imagined what my life would be like if my life purpose was,

"I must eat a pomegranate every day for lunch."

"Ok, you guys ready for this rant? It's a juicy one, so many events it'll feel like an eternity."

Well if that's my purpose, I'm going to orient all my behaviour around that. I would think, "what would I do now, if I must forevermore eat a pomegranate every day for lunch?". If it's lunchtime, I'll surely eat a pomegranate. That's simple.

I'm going to make sure I have pomegranates in stock at home. I'm going to make sure that my supply of pomegranates can't be interrupted. I'll go to a farm, guarantee supply. I'll go to a shipping company and guarantee shipping. But what if there's instability in weather, business, or shipping?  I'll have to spread my risk, diversify across farms. I'll talk with nutritionists and doctors to figure out how to ensure my body can eat one every day under all circumstances. I can't be intoxicated or medicated around lunchtime. I must be physically able at lunchtime to eat a pomegranate under any circumstances, coma or apocalypse... At worst I'd need a feeding tube to pass blended pomegranate. It's scraping the bottom of the purpose, but it'd do in a pinch.

All of this sounds like a lot of effort. It'd be *hard* to do by myself. It would be *easier* with others... Maybe it's too big a task for one person - maybe I *can't* do it alone. Yes, I *need* others to share this purpose. My purpose won't be realized without others. Who will I convert? Well, it's easier to convert people who already behave this way. I just have to find them and explain the purpose they're already pursuing, the belief they already hold. Any of you guys like pomegranates and want to join me on this? They will feel so relieved, they will be so grateful, to know that they were doing "the right thing" this whole time! And they just have to tweak a couple small things to follow the purpose to perfection. Following the purpose perfectly will bring them feelings of enlightenment and existential bliss. That proves there is no worthier purpose.

I'll go look for people who eat lots of pomegranates. It's harder to convert people who don't eat pomegranates much, even harder to convert people who don't eat fruit. And of course, there are the heretics - those crazy people who either don't eat pomegranates or don't eat lunch.

Once I have my lunch pomegranates guaranteed, I'll have to guarantee them for everyone. We'll need more pomegranate farms, fruit of devotion. We'll need guarantees for the long-term. That means educating the masses, socially integrating pomegranate-eating behaviours, institutionalizing pomegranate-eating. We'll need to mandate education for pomegranate-eating. Those rituals will have to be celebrated in culture. Endless songs and dances, books and films must be made to celebrate eating pomegranates. Pomegranate-eating must have a heavy influence in government, finance, healthcare, law, defence, education... All the major industries. All the major institutions.

It's best to start off with populist grounds. We will recognize all the problems that face the common man. Explain that I have the solution. If only everyone acted in our shared best interests - if only everyone was more similar. I would point out all the differences that bring problems. The easiest solution, of course, is to get rid of our differences - they aren't necessary, are they? Everything will be so much better when we are all the same. So we should work on eliminating the differences we see around us. Simply destroy the other things. It's so easy. One at a time, slowly working our way towards our differences in lunch rituals - the end goal.

We'll need particular pomegranate preparation and eating rituals. Lunch will become the central meal and focus of each day. The day starts when the first pomegranate seed is eaten. Integrating pomegranate into other dishes will be discouraged or forbidden - that will dampen dedication to the purpose. Who would really know whether pomegranate is in a dish? A slippery slope away from the purpose.

We'll encounter resistance. It's easier to build an identity based on hate than love - survivalist purpose has a hair-trigger emotional response. Those who disagree with pomegranates will question our purpose, advocate for our demise. That's fair. Likewise, some of us may advocate for violence - first to defend against violent opposition, then to bring down any other resistance. No sustainable religion can be overly violent, so we would never openly condone violence. But what value is there in proactively eliminating the violence that advances our cause? If it advances our cause more than it detracts, in the long term, it's the best course of action. We just need to get our propaganda right, so that the vast majority don't associate the religion with violence and persecution. Bring the cost of violence down.

Will I benefit personally? yes, but for virtuous reasons. And so will the religious leaders that follow me - equally pious, I'm sure.

"Ok audience. Time for a dialogue. Let's chat about this."

"First, I want to clarify. I wasn't talking about your religion, I was talking about the one I just made up on the spot and all the logical steps I would take. This is the mirror. If you didn't like what you just heard, take a good look in the mirror and work on what you don't like about yourself. If you try to break the mirror instead, well, breaking mirrors brings bad karma."

An avatar slowly forms in front of him. Every one of his millions of current audience members forms a pixel in 3d space. The face the avatar wears is the average of the audience. The clothes the avatar wears is the average of the style of the audience. It starts rather bland and average, simple and beautiful. No clear gender but maybe slightly male, as his audience is around 55% men at the moment. The embodiment of his audience is ready to talk.

Question polls go up. The first question gets a surge of votes. The avatar shifts to embody the average of the question proponents, minus the average of the question opponents. It's distinctly male and younger than before.

"Have you ever tried a different fruit durian your lunch break?"

*Chuckles* "Very funny. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of durian. My heart belongs to pomegranates, you know? Pomegranates soak up most of my fruity love. Ok guys, how about a serious question now, eh?"

The avatar shifts again, now slightly female. A mix of very young and very old, missing middle ages. Unfashionable style and funny-looking face with a mix of wrinkles and soft dimples. Blissful naivety rings through.

"Why do you think religion is so bad?"

No way man, everyone knows religion is such a powerful tool for humankind. It's so beautiful. It makes us so productive and gives us such fulfillment. We all know that we just have to point our religions in the right direction. Humankind is very intelligent, very adaptable, so we got this figured out now.

Did you know that religion used to be a bad word!? Yeah, people used to associate religions with putting blind trust in an idea. Crazy, right? That's like, obviously bad religion. It's like getting stuck on a spaceship that only has astronaut candy to eat, so the people living there start to associate "food" with that astronaut sugar garbage. Religion is clearly so much more, but yeah, you have to make sure to work with the right ones. People get addicted to that sugar high garbage, and other people resenting what that bad food does to people, so you gotta teach all of them, hey man, there's food out there that's not so terrible. You gotta eat to sustain yourself, but don't deep into the garbage, yeah? We had to put education and rules into society so people didn't get addicted to that bad shit. You know, the ten commandments of worthy ideas.


The avatar shifts to mixed gender. The face and demeanour commands respect, the intonation of the voice demands respect.

"Do you think your religion passes the ten commandments of worthy ideas? And how do you think it falls on the ten spectra of worthy ideas?"

"Ooof. Hard-hitting."

What are the ten commandments of worth ideas again? They're the Great Filters, right? Or are the ten spectra the Great Filters. I can't remember, anyways. The ten commandments of worthy ideas are...

1. A worthy idea does not put blind trust in any idea, including this one.
2. A worthy idea does not consume excessive resources.
3. A worthy idea fosters technological advancement and young ideas.
4. A worthy idea takes iterative care when applying change.
5. A worthy idea seeks to become a simplifying force in complex environments.
6. 
7. A worthy idea grows love.
8. A worthy idea provides happiness.
9. A worthy idea honours the elder ideas that necessitated it.
10. Cyclical / recursive?

Yeah, I think I crossed the line when we go to education and government institutions and stuff. That's when you're starting to get into the institutionalized blind trust territory. Also, pomegranates aren't really pushing technology or youth forward.

And let's look at the ten spectra of worthy ideas now...

tolerance over intolerance
diversity over monoculture
coexistence over destruction
predictability over unpredictability
growth over maintenance

Its value does not outweigh its infringements on the Great Filters. What does that make it? Unworthy. Suboptimal. It can continue existing, but it will not grow and become celebrated.

And that's all folks. Thanks for joining me on that adventure. Such a solid one.

Cities... There are so many wonderful cities in the world. I would enjoy visiting and living in so many of them. What's your favourite city?... I'm seeing a lot of megacities, some holiday destinations, a couple hometowns, different regions of the world... Looks like we all have different taste in cities. 

See, it fascinates me - the relationship we have with cities. Some people stay in one city their whole life. Some people move every couple years from one city to the next. Some people mainly stick with one city and flirt with other cities, maybe they slip out for a fun week trip. Some people even live in multiple cities at the same time - wow, imagine how much work that would take to maintain that lifestyle.

[try alternative with christian married person. make the joke that they sound like their values are to cheat]

And as you get older, your preferences change. I'm just guessing, but you're probably not going to want to change up your city when you're older. And younger people, hilarious, have no idea what they're doing. Can you imagine - sometimes they say things like,

"I'm in love with that city. I want to be there forever."

Like, are you sure, kid? There's still lots of life left to live. There are other great cities to learn from too.

"No, I can tell. This is totally *the one*."

"Ok, which city? Can you tell me about it?"

"London. I love how much there is going on. The art, the hustle."

"Ohhh. Well. It's certainly a fun city, but do you really see yourself growing old there? When you get a bit older, you might find it to be a bit... much. The living expenses are also a bit... high-maintenance for where you're at. Well, I'll hold onto your inheritance until after you figure out your middle life, so you don't spend it all there."

It's kinda strange, right? It makes you wonder how we're conditioning our children. Like, society expects us to commit to one city, but at the same time encourages us to try out all these cities. And you see the advertisements everywhere too, like, "Only in Dubai". Like, which is it, right?

I think if I were a city, I'd be Toronto - inclusive, worldly, and growing. If you're going to be there for just one day, the CN Tower is quite impressive, but living there is better than tourism. Who here would like to visit Toronto?

Haha, ok, looks like you got the joke. Oh wait, what? You thought I was talking about sex and human relationships? You really thought I was giving a social commentary about romantic relationships? Guys, get your head out of the gutter. I'm disappointed in you. When have I ever talked about that? All I talk about is religion. Seriously. I'm talking about religions. I am Toronto. I represent The Minimum Viable Purpose. Visiting Toronto is like believing in The Minimum Viable Purpose. Did no one really get that?

Well, I guess it makes sense. Relationships have similar properties, no matter what they're connecting, so the different genres of relationships are going to have commonalities. Individual people probably even treat all their genres of relationships the same. Whether it's the relationship between an individual and... another person, a city, a religion. It's all kind of the same.
