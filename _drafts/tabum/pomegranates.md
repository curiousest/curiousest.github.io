*Our intuition for worthy ideas is not scientific, yet.*

I love pomegranates. I have love for so many things, and pomegranates are one of them.

I eat a pomegranate every day with lunch. One day, I imagined what my life would be like if my purpose was,

"I must eat a pomegranate every day for lunch."

Well if that's my purpose, I'm going to orient all my behaviour around that. I would think, "what would I do now, if I must forevermore eat a pomegranate every day for lunch?". If it's lunchtime, I'll surely eat a pomegranate. That's simple.

I'm going to make sure I have pomegranates in stock at home. I'm going to make sure that my supply of pomegranates can't be interrupted. I'll go to a farm, guarantee supply. I'll go to a shipping company and guarantee shipping. But what if there's instability in weather, business, or shipping?  I'll have to spread my risk, diversify across farms. I'll talk with nutritionists and doctors to figure out how to ensure my body can eat one every day under all circumstances. I can't be intoxicated or medicated around lunchtime. I must be physically able at lunchtime to eat a pomegranate under any circumstances, coma or apocalypse... At worst I'd need a feeding tube to pass blended pomegranate. It's scraping the bottom of the purpose, but it'd do in a pinch.

All of this sounds like a lot of effort. It'd be *hard* to do by myself. It would be *easier* with others... Maybe it's too big a task for one person - maybe I *can't* do it alone. Yes, I *need* others to share this purpose. My purpose won't be realized without others. Who will I convert? Well, it's easier to convert people who already behave this way. I just have to find them and explain the purpose they're already pursuing, the belief they already hold. They will feel so relieved, they will be so grateful, to know that they were doing "the right thing" this whole time! And they just have to tweak a couple small things to follow the purpose to perfection. Following the purpose perfectly will bring them feelings of enlightenment and existential bliss. That proves there is no worthier purpose.

I'll go look for people who eat lots of pomegranates. It's harder to convert people who don't eat pomegranates much, even harder to convert people who don't eat fruit. And of course, there are the heretics - those crazy people who either don't eat pomegranates or don't eat lunch.

Once I have my lunch pomegranates guaranteed, I'll have to guarantee them for everyone. We'll need more pomegranate farms, fruit of devotion. We'll need guarantees for the long-term. That means educating the masses, socially integrating pomegranate-eating behaviours, institutionalizing pomegranate-eating. We'll need to mandate education for pomegranate-eating. Those rituals will have to be celebrated in culture. Endless songs and dances, books and films must be made to celebrate eating pomegranates. Pomegranate-eating must have a heavy influence in government, finance, healthcare, law, defence, education... All the major industries. All the major institutions.

We'll need particular pomegranate preparation and eating rituals. Lunch will become the central meal and focus of each day. The day starts when the first pomegranate seed is eaten. Integrating pomegranate into other dishes will be discouraged or forbidden - that will dampen dedication to the purpose. Who would really know whether pomegranate is in a dish? A slippery slope away from the purpose.

We'll encounter resistance. It's easier to build an identity based on hate than love - survivalist purpose has a hair-trigger. Those who disagree with pomegranates will question our purpose, advocate for our demise. That's fair. Likewise, some of us may advocate for violence - first to defend against violent opposition, then to bring down any other resistance. No sustainable religion can be overly violent, so we would never openly condone violence. But what value is there in proactively eliminating the violence that advances our cause? If it advances our cause more than it detracts, in the long term, it's the best course of action. We just need to get our propaganda right, so that the vast majority don't associate the religion with violence and persecution. Bring the cost of violence down.

Will I benefit personally? yes, but for virtuous reasons. And so will the religious leaders that follow me - equally pious, I'm sure.

Wow, religion is such a powerful tool for humankind. So beautiful, that it can operate with such force and give people such fulfillment. I hope we point our religions in the right direction. I'm confident that we do, I'm confident that we will - humankind is very intelligent, very adaptable. I wonder if this religion passes through the great filters...

The ten commandments of viable purpose (the Great Filters):

1. A worthy idea does not put blind trust in any idea, including this one.
2. A worthy idea helps other ideas survive.
3. A worthy idea does not consume excessive resources.
4. A worthy idea fosters technological advancement and young ideas.
5. A worthy idea takes iterative care when applying change.
6. A worthy idea favours coexistence over destruction, diversity over monoculture, and intolerance of intolerance over intolerance.
7. A worthy idea grows love.
8. A worthy idea provides happiness.
9. A worthy idea does not provide excessive happiness.
10. A worthy idea honours the elder purposes that preceded it.

My pomegranates follows all the commandments except #2 and #6. It doesn't foster diversity. It needs all people to eat the same thing for lunch, and doesn't allow for others. It doesn't help other ideas survive, either. Its value does not outweigh its infringements on the Great Filters. It is not a worthy idea. It can continue existing, but it will not grow and become celebrated.

this feels a bit too heavy, beating dead horse. Keep it lighter.

But anyone can believe in pomegranates for lunch *and* another purpose, right? Maybe they'll clash a bit sometimes, but that's ok. So we can have multiple purposes.
