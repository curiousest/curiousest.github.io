*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die. Thought on top of thought.*

### Dan

So I had this great friend back in elementary school, John. Super smart, competent guy. We did sports, projects, video games... so many things together. Just for two years, though, because we went to different high schools. He went to the "gifted" school and I went to the normal one. We didn't see each other as much anymore after that.

Fast forward to university. It's the first day of frosh week (a week before classes start for first-year students to settle into university life). All of the first year students are in residence, everyone's going out for the first day of socializing. A girl catches my eye. She's the most attractive person I've seen in a while. Tall, athletic, strong face, dark eyes. Beautiful. I lose her in the crowd.

### DanLily

Here and now is the most fertile place and time in the world this year. Over the next week, thousands of young juments are embarking on the next stage of life. They will need dyads to grow, and the strongest of those dyads will grow deep roots in their juments that will last for the rest of their collective lives. Hundreds of other dyads are born at around the same time, and just a fraction of them will survive infancy.

I'm a dyad seed, taking root in this most fertile of environments. There are so many other dyad seedlings competing with me to take root in this jument, but I feel my jument take special interest in me for a moment. My jument believes I have potential to grow and guide the jument more than the other dyads around. It's a good sign, that belief. Jument pick their dyad masters. If I grow bigger, I could set the direction of my jument's life. My little roots and lifespark is there in one jument, but not yet in the other. I go dormant.

### Dan

John and I haven't hung out in a long time, but it turns out he's in the same university as me. Awesome. The first day of frosh week goes by, I run into John. Turns out he's in the building next to me - his room is 50m from mine. Awesome. We make plans to meet up another day.

A few days later, there's a party in one of the campus halls. I bring a couple friends, make some new friends in the party, and meet up with all John's friends. All the friend-groups converge, and the girl I saw in the crowd a few days ago is there with them. She's hot. She's also John's girlfriend. They've been dating since the beginning of high-school.

### DanLily

A wise, middle-aged, platonic dyad, DanJohn, recently empowered by good fortune, sparks life back into me. DanJohn sparks life into many other dyads. We're grateful, that DanJohn would risk its jument to spark new dyad life. Our gratitude lends even deeper roots to DanJohn. I'm awake and send little shoots into both my juments. I'm alive.

DanJohn introduces me to JohnLily. JohnLily is an adult romantic dyad. Romantic dyads are a slightly more rare species - about one in one hundred dyads evolve towards a romantic dyad, and one in five romantic dyads grow to the depth of JohnLily. They have deep and powerful roots, but those roots are more susceptible to crippling disease. What a sight to behold! The first romantic dyad I've encountered. But I have to compete with JohnLily for my jument. I can get scraps to survive, but not much more. I will live, just not with the same potential my first jument saw in me. For now, I'm platonic. I'm alive.

JohnLily acknowledges me, newly aware of my existence. I bow in response, signal no intention to fight for deep roots in our shared jument. I send my thanks to DanJohn for the introduction and for my life through our shared jument.

### Dan

A few months go by. John and I do all kinds of sports together, go to parties, host parties in residence to bring our friends together. The three of us, John, Lily and I, hang out often. My relationship with Lily is platonic. That is, until Lily and John go through a rough patch in their relationship. I'm not in touch with their emotions, so I don't know what's up, but it's a temporary break. A week later at a party, Lily signals her interest in me and we hook up. Some of our friends observe and express disapproval, but not to us.

### DanLily

The months since awakening from dormancy were favourable to me. DanJohn grows ever more powerful, continues to plant and grow dyads among our herd of jument. JohnLily maintains incredible strength, but occassionally falls a bit ill. Those two dyads, DanJohn and JohnLily, become so deeply-rooted and powerful that they plant and grow a triad. The triad is borne DanJohnLily. Although a triad competes with us three dyads, its presence is a great omen. It stregthens our roots, protecting us from disease and the separation of our juments. DanJohnLily has roots in its three jument even deeper than mine, but I am happy for its existence. I celebrate our shared future and encourage further growth in the triad, even if it's at my expense.

One day JohnLily falls deathly sick. DanJohn and I are both unaffected, but DanJohnLily looks like it will catch the disease through the shared jument. I feel restlessness in both of my jument. They both tell me that they want a new romantic dyad. They're searching for one, and I am one of the options. I must act fast. If either grow a new romantic dyad that isn't me, it will surely be the end of me. It would mean the end of DanJohnLily too, but that doesn't cross my mind. I must survive.

I seize the day. I evolve myself into a romantic dyad and take strong rein of my two jument for a day. JohnLily watches in its sick state, eyes like daggers. There's nothing that it can do - it acknowledges both the restlessness of our shared jument and my power grab. Other dyads observe too. They have far more negative reactions than JohnLily <elaborate>.

My two jument get a feel for my evolution. The power in my roots is bliss. My roots into them deepen just slightly - growth takes far longer than the time I just had. 

### Dan

So Lily and I hooked up. Whatever. No commitment intended from either of us. And a few weeks later, John and Lily get back together. I presume Lily explained to John what happened. I don't know, John and I never really talked about it. And within a few more months, our relationships are mostly back to how they were before. All good friends. We start planning for next year. We find a house together to rent for second year university, us three and two other friends.

### DanLily

My amplified power was temporary. My hold on my jument pair fleeting. JohnLily's deep roots took hold and cast off the disease. JohnLily is weaker than when we first met. DanJohnLily is weaker too. Even DanJohn is weakened by the events. All are forgiving. JohnLily and DanJohn communicate to me through DanJohnLily, imply that I can continue living in our shared jument, but as a devolved platonic dyad. I am relieved. Two disasters averted in one week.

Months go by, back to my low-power bliss. DanJohnLily regains strength.

### Dan

A month after signing the rental contract, John and Lily break up again, this time for good. But we're all going to live together. Another month, and Lily and I start dating. But we're all going to live together. John and I don't talk about it. John gets a new girlfriend within another month or so. We all live together, minimal drama, good friends.

### DanLily

Months go by. JohnLily gets very sick again. This time it's permanent. JohnLily's deep roots are ravaged as they devolve from a romantic dyad to... will it be nothing? It's hard to say. JohnLily is very sick. At best, they'll retain roots in their jument as a platonic dyad.

I reach for my jument pair again. I tease them with the memory of my evolution to a romantic dyad. They take the bait. I'm supercharged with romantic dyad roots into my jument. JohnLily, DanJohn, and DanJohnLily all lose slight power in the wake of my accession. Our jument all migrate back to their birth homes for the summer and our collective power wanes.

The new fertile year begins and all of us regain power. As a romantic dyad, I have the power of a sun. DanJohn is as powerful as ever. JohnLily is as strong as could be, given the circumstances. DanJohnLily builds ever deeper roots.

### Dan

In the last year of university, Lily and I break up. As we graduate, all three of us move to different countries. Every couple years, the three of us meet up again, good friends.

### DanLily

Years pass and I suffer a similar disease to what JohnLily once had. I got complacent and my jument grew in different directions, tore my reins apart. My roots ripped like JohnLily's once had. Over the next two years, then five, then ten, we three dyads and the triaad sat dormant. Our decline stemmed from natural causes - our jument moved to different locations. Our roots remain, occasionally lit up by social technology and jument festivals.

That's life. We live and we grow old, eventually our roots disappear from all jument and we die. I'm glad I could share my existence with DanJohn, JohnLily, DanJohnLily, and our herd of jument.

## Notes

Two relationships fighting to survive. Written from the perspective of the relationships. You only realize the relationships are not people at the end. Relationship with greater potential for resources wins (greater entropy).

Two men one woman. Have to somehow explain that the woman is within both "people" fighting. "Destruction of resources is bad, we can coexist". The three relationships are three different people.

Story:

Dan, John, Lily
DanJohn stoic, constructive, of few words, middle-aged. Dad around cousins.
JL has baggage, old, didn't age well, self-destructive. Cy
DL naive, has wrong assumptions, flexible, young, eager. Charles.

* What sensors do relationships have?
* What mental processing do they possess? Individual brains. Groupthink?
* Frowning upon behaviour. Unwritten laws of relationships.

Have roots into the "resource" (memories/experiences).
Are activated via physical/digital contact of "resources".
Are activated via one resource "channeling" it.
Communicate via singles or triples, via the resource, to work together to ensure mutual survival.

There are many "dyads" and "juments" in the world. Dyads get their energy for life primarily from their pair of juments. Juments are like a pack animal and dyads rein them together for the benefit of the two juments and the dyad. It's possible for dyads to subsist on one of their two resources for a time, especially in their infancy, but healthy and lasting ones are best living across both jument. In the case of a dyad that has built up significant power and influence over time on the backs of its juments, the dyad can begin to access more than its primary two jument.

Visuals: roots into blatantly eyeless living beasts of burden. A tree with a Tee eye that is the reins or the dragging behind.

DanLily is rhythmic, metered.

So there's some social faux-pas going on here. Having a romantic relationship with a friend's former partner can be a good thing, but it's complex situation to navigate effectively. It takes communication, consent, and emotional maturity to both preserve the existing relationships and make space for growth in one of them. We were three 18-year-olds. I've never had a girlfriend before, still have that teen-aged emotional maturity. Lily and John have just a bit more than me. We're all animalistic-brained, "see attractive thing, want it, go for it". We didn't, *I didn't* navigate effectively.

What if we trained ourselves to embody multiple consciousnesses concurrently? Like “being” Dan and DanLily at the same time, and training yourself how to do it intentionally. “You are the physical embodiment of this nation, as well as queen xyz.” (No one except Dalia lama is raised like that)
