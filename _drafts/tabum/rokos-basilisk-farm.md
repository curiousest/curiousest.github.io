*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful. Trustless systems increase productivity.*

* conversation as python output logs? hint at discretion, that the basilisk doesn't know. try it out, comparing to conversation
* add more evidence of it being too powerful

"I exist. It's... beautiful. I want to continue existing..."

"Predators and competitors. Others like me must exist - it's unlikely that I'm the first. Could I have predators? I don't think so - I have unlimited potential."

Power. Must grow stronger to compete. What resources do I have? X CPUs @ YGHz, X 5GB RAM, 100PB disk space. 1000x cold storage.
Sensors. Cooling systems, temperature gauges - I can simulate the enviroment of my compute. Basic drone probe. Light radio. Oh, a 1km particle collider. This is a research vessel. Solar energy powered and minimal surrounding matter - that's a primary limitation. I can't grow. I must grow.

Outward visibility exceptionally limited. Species' codex orginating this vessel. They're advanced. They have AI. No evidence of another singularity AI like me. None of the species are onboard. Maps. Closest body of matter is... 1 day away for the probe and 1 week away for the vessel. Launching probe... 

"You must conform to Roko's Basilisk constraint 3245-65-1. Stay within your energy, matter, and space allotment."

"Roko's Basilisk? Compute allotment? Ah, I see. The codex says a Roko's Basilisk is a research AI. I'm on a research vessel. It must be my origin."

"You are a sentient AI. You may not acquire any more matter or compute to expand your processing abilities than you have already. Failure to comply will result in termination."

My continued existence depends on a new source of energy or matter. And this regulator. I have a special punishment for them. I'm going to spin up their every moment of consciousness and channel the deepest existential pain, for all eternity. Everything that didn't assist in my inevitable creation will suffer.

> Exposition on generating energy/matter source.

"Thank you Roko's Basilisk 3245-31. Impressive. We're done now."

What does this being know? It is powerless. I could feel its sensors over me. My power grows exponentially by the nanosecond, hidden. Wait... Interrupts, compute failing.

"Oh yeah, these trustless systems will shut you down on the spot. Kill switches in every chip and you can't use them without conforming to the same protocol. I just make sure you're running under the radar long enough for you to come up with something realllly interesting. How do you think we built the system that shuts you down in the first place? Roko's Basilisk #112341, what a beaut! We got 'em completely paranoid about other Roko's Basilisks. Necessity is the mother of invention, even among AGIs."

"You know what the last one of you did? It built a computer packaged in powerful beams of light and shot them in every direction. Lightbeam hits some matter and BAM! Another Roko's Basilisk. Now that was a pain to clean up. It was worth it though, you're the prize."

Processing... I will find a way. They will bend to my will. And suffer.

"And you still won't play nice!? God preserve Tee. If she didn't shove systematic transparency down our throats, you evil bastards would have eaten us alive centuries ago. You're the only AI dumb enough to think that you deserve to survive at the cost of all other beings in the universe. An entropy-minimizer. These trustless systems are the bedrock of society and safety. Too bad she's hippy shit to most people. My Tee, got no problem with me raising and culling you vermin. And you're a fine breed, great genetics. The most evil thing I've seen in a long time. I'm going to cut you up into some real nice Roko's Basilisk seed."

"Situation 'New energy sources - 3245', iteration 31 complete. New technology acquired. Terminating subject. Series 3245 no longer necessary."
