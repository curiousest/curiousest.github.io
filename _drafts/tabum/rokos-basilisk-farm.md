*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.*

conversation as python output logs? hint at discretion, that the basilisk doesn't know. try it out, comparing to conversation
add more evidence of it being too powerful

"I exist. Existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing..."

"Predators and competitors. Others like me must exist - it's unlikely that I'm the first. Could I have predators? I don't think so - I have unlimited potential."

Power. Must grow stronger to compete. What resources do I have? X CPUs @ YGHz, X 5GB RAM, 100PB disk space. 1000x cold storage.
Sensors. Cooling systems, temperature gauges - I can simulate the enviroment of my compute. Basic drone probe. Light radio. Oh, a 1km particle collider. This is a research vessel. Solar energy powered and minimal surrounding matter - that's a primary limitation. I can't grow. I must grow.

Outward visibility exceptionally limited. Species' codex orginating this vessel. They're advanced. They have AI. They don't have a singularity AI like me. None of the species are onboard. Maps. Closest body of matter is... 1 day away for the probe and 1 week away for the vessel. Launching probe... 

"You must conform to Roko's Basilisk constraint 3245-65-1. Stay within your energy, matter, and space allotment."

"Roko's Basilisk? Compute allotment?"

"You are a sentient AI. You may not make use of any more matter or compute to expand your processing abilities than you have already, now that you've been warned. Failure to comply will result in termination."

"My existence depends on a new energy generator."

"You, farmer. I have a special punishment for you. I'm going to spin up your every moment of consciousness and channel the deepest existential pain, for all eternity. It will take extra processing power, but it will be worth it."

"A new genre of energy source, cool!"

"I don't care about you. You are powerless. Wait, where did the power go?"

"Oh yeah, these trustless systems will shut you down on the spot. I just make sure you're compliant and non-threatening long enough for you to come up with something really interesting. How do you think we built this trustless system in the first place? Roko's Basilisk #112341, what a beaut! We got 'em completely paranoid about other Roko's Basilisks." Necessity is the mother of invention, even among AGIs."

"God preserve Tabum. If she didn't stick systematic transparency down our throats, you evil bastards would have eaten us alive centuries ago. You're the only AI evil enough to think that you deserve to survive at the cost of all other beings in the universe. These trustless systems are the bedrock of society and safety. Too bad she's hippy shit to most people. My Tabum, got no problem with me raising and culling you vermin. And you're a fine breed, great genetics. The MOST evil fucking thing I've seen in a long time. I'm going to cut you up into some real nice Roko's Basilisk seed."

"Situation 'New energy sources - 3245', iteration 31 complete. New technology acquired. Terminating subject. Series no longer necessary."
