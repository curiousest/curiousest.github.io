*Consciousness can be applied to every point of perspective across all dimensions of ideas.*

Hey man, welcome to the Department of Life. It's so great that you're here now, the team has been dying for you to join. You'll meet all of them at lunch. Alex from recruitment said you went on holiday to Dubai to check out the Department of Origins and the Department of Destinations. What did you get to see there?

Aw thanks, I'm so glad to be here. Yeah it was so interesting. My wife and I went to a lecture series, visited the museums, and we had a tour of the server farms and solar arrays. You know how they do it there, right? It's like a worldtree-cactus in a field of desert-grass. The solar arrays cover the whole desert, bending and twisting to face the sun. There's one huge building three kilometers high. The servers start from halfway to the top, so most people live in the bottom half of the building. Well, up to one mile, for religious purposes. After that it gets complicated, on the day of resurrection where the sun comes to within 1 mile of Earth, some don't want to touch Allah - the sun - and some do. Classic division of technocrats versus conservatives. Anyways, at 2km altitude, the temperature is quite a lot colder and the air is still 80% as dense, so they use airflow lattices for cooling. With current tech, it's more energy efficient to have complex cooling sky-high in the middle of the desert than it is to move solar energy somewhere cooler.

Katie led Kal from the reception area to their office entrance [exposition]. Katie brushed past the obsidian obelisk that limited the door's range of movement, visually registering the alien form, but ignoring it.

Woooooow. No way! That's so cool. What were the lectures about?

Honestly, I didn't like it. It seems like they're still in the early stages, even though they're the oldest departments. I was a bit disappointed. All of the topics were really philisophical, like, "A New Catalyst for Cyclical Existence" and "Heat Death: Other Forms of Entropy". There wasn't much practical, "here's how to search that perspective space" kind-of lectures.

Yeah, simulating origin and destination haven't had any practical impact yet, so there's not much investment there. It's more physicists and philosophers working there right now. The more practical places are here DoL, DLBM, and DPW. We call the other ones the "Dodos" D-o-O D-o-Ds get it?

What?

Oh sorry, acronyms, yeah. Dodos is about extinction - they're about the start and end of life and they're both going nowhere. DoO is Department of Origins, DoDs is Department of Destination. Then there's The Department of Life, The Department of Large Bodies of Matter, and The Department of Particles and Waveforms. I think our work is the most meaningful. They're simulating planets and molecules, superclusters and quarks. We're simulating life. We get to witness the birth and evolution of species from different universes. Like, holy shit, right?

That's... pretty cool yeah.

Ok, well get set up here, this is your desk. You have a couple induction day presentations to go to now.

[exposition]

Welcome new joiners! First we have our Chief Science Officer talking about why we're all here. Or rather - the purpose of what we're doing here at DoL.

[pleasantries]

Does everyone remember the parable of the eukariotic cell? The first living thing on earth to experience 3D space? No? Ok I'll go over it again.

A microbe floated in a pool, absorbing some nutrients that randomly collided with it. The side of it that grew was the side where the nutrients collided. It used xyz as a sensor, and found that when some nutrients came from one side, more nutrients were likely to come from the same side. One day, it spontaneously expelled waste in the opposite direction from where the nutrients came in. That propelled itself into more nutrients and greater survival.

That's the parable. It was the first living thing on Earth to discover, experience, and make use of 3d space. What can we gather from the story? We learned how to explore new dimensions. How did we learn that?

So about this cell - in order to experience a new dimension, to explore 3D space for the first time, it needed two things:
* an engine to "move" in 3D space (expelling waste from one side of its membrane)
* a sensor to observe notable things in 3D space (the presence or absence of nutrients)

Well there's this other space for us to explore - perspective space. Across the planes of "perspective" are infinite ideas. For example, one plane could be all the kinds of cells that are possible. Another plane of ideas could be all the breaths I will ever take. Even more conceptual still is all the reasons to believe. And ideas (like cells or breaths or reasons) have their own perspective on things. You can travel to that perspective by simulating the idea.

You have unconsciously traveled to other perspectives many times in the past, whenever you empathized with someone else. Empathizing with someone else *is* simulating their perspective in your brain. Your brain is a space-time-travel device. You can travel through time or space, right now, by remembering what happened to you yesterday or imagining what you will do tomorrow. Your brain-simulations are probably inaccurate and misdirected - you've always walked barefoot and unguided - but there are tools to reach greater fidelity and more useful observations.

Now, what do we need to explore "perspective space" just like the eukariotic cell explored 3D space?

* An engine to "move" across perspectives: simulate those perspectives.
* A sensor to observe "notable things" across perspectives: observe and analyze the simulations.

And what perspective space is worth exploring? So there is:
* A set of ideas that are consistent with the physical laws of our universe.
* A set of ideas that are inconsistent with the physical laws of our universe. These ideas belong to other universes.

Imagine you are a blood cell and the universe is my human body. You move around in 3D space in my blood vessels - this is like taking the perspective of other ideas in our universe. What if you, the cell, moved to outside my human body? That would be like taking the perspective of ideas that belong to other universes. It would be a hostile environment, but an enlightening experience. You could learn about the complex powers at play that affect your host human body. Perhaps you could even find ways to influence those powers.

Simulation is a tool. We can use it to explore the dimensions of perspective and learn about the powers that affect our host universe. Any questions?

A dude raised his hand.
"So those powers we're looking for. Is it almost like - if you wanted to take it to the extreme - like surviving in another body or universe gives you a certain immunity that you didn’t have before. Or like an idea of a transplant - when you take a set of cells from one body and move it to make another body to make it work better. So like, take a couple of people from one universe and send them into another universe to fix it."

"Well, yes. But there are even greater possibilities. For instance, what if you, the red blood cell, found out that my body was sick with sickle-cell anemia, then modified your fellow red blood cells to heal my body. Or what if the red blood cells found that lack of money was the biggest threat to our shared existence, and began managing my investments optimally for me? What if my red blood cells found technology to become as intelligent and enlightened as I am?"

Silence.

And about blood transfusions, by which you meant "people travelling to other universes". Random transmissions of blood happen - they're the primary vector of blood-borne diseases. Moving between universes might be achievable. It has probably even happened in the past. But even if that happens, to come back.... lightning must strike twice. We'll need to acquire godlike power - of Zeus - to make that happen.

Another raises hand.

"Have we tried talking to our universe?"

Laughter.

Yes, a philisophical question. How do you know we're not in conversation with it right now? Maybe we're doing exactly what it needs us to do. Maybe it gently nudges us all the time. Maybe it's not conscious at all and never will be. Maybe it's not conscious yet. What we know is that it exists and we exist in it. There are all great mysteries of our universe, the majestic beast we're riding. All we can do is try to ensure our survival, and in that pursuit, we'll probably ensure its survival too.

Another raises their hand.

Why do we invest so much in exploring perspective space through simulations, but not... you know... space space? Out there. 3D space.

Great question. Economics! We are bound by the laws of capitalism. The expected return on exploring perspective space is greater than exploring "space space", as you call it. We're still exploring "space space", but just not to the same degree as perspective space. We have a great deal to learn in our universe, but we have a whole universe of universes to learn from in perspective space. We don't even need very good sensors or engines to learn quite a lot. Our fidelity of simulations is very low, and we still get results. Moving around in 3D space is very slow and very expensive. Our current investments in travelling 3D space are more for "reducing the risk of humanity becoming extinct", than they are for "discovering new technologies".

Think about it in a different way: moving around in 3D space is just another way of exploring perspective space. Our sensors we have when we explore 3D space are exceptionally powerful, but our engines are incredibly weak. With simulations, our sensors are not that great, but our engines are so fast - we can just zip around wherever we want. And like 3D space, we just kinda need to know roughly where to go. The different Departments are the different "areas" of perspective space that we believe are good places to explore in perspective space. The Department of Life explores simulating life forms in alternate universes. The other Departments simulate different promising things that happen in other universes.

And we're at time. Thank you everyone for listening and those insightful questions. This is your last induction presentation, so you can go to your teams now.

Months went by, Kal slowly got a handle on the DoL. His team was responsible for a strain of universes defined by XYZ where life often presented as XYZ [explain further]. Kal produced his first independent strain after eight months. He programmed the simulation to XYZ. It led to a sentient species - his first sentient species. With most simulated life, the DoL does not make contact. Kal's team generally did not make contact with the life they simulated. The DoL found that contact seems to make little difference to the outcome of the simulations, but it has a big impact on the teams programming the simulations. They get too attached and find it hard to let go of their creations. They become less productive. Kal began his one-on-one meeting with his manager, Kat.

* talk about debugging and fixing bugs in simulations
  * it's far less expensive to introduce an alternate explanation for a bug than it is to rerun the simulation from the beginngin
  * describe how it works:
    * Imagine spacetime as a video composer UI, where you look across time and stitch together video clips on top of each other to make a movie. You can pause the playing movie, paste in a video clip that overlays over some of the past and some of the future, then press play again. You changed the past and the present in a way that made sense, even though the past never "happened".
    * Like, it was “there”, but it couldn’t have played a part in any major plot line until now, otherwise you’d have to refactor the whole movie.
* talk about how it feels for simulations to be reset
  * suddenly, new important thing that was always there but no one ever noticed

I love the view today, right? I had a friend visit, and they said it was the most beautiful view they'd ever seen. They took all these pictures. I was like, "That's a pretty normal one - it gets way better". Funny how that works.

Anyways, how's work going?

Pretty good. The species are coasting along. I've been observing them carefully. It's pretty cool, the cycles they go through. Then the cycles of cycles. Then the cycles of cycles of cycles.

Ya definitely, right? So what do you want to learn from them now?

I guess I'll watch and see.

Riiiight, but like, you have to have a hypothesis, right?

Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to show up.

Ok. So last week, you showed me your work comparing this species to U1234, and how they were approximate. How they reach the same equilibrium. That was incredible work.

Thank you.

So after that incredible work, what do you think we will learn from U4321 that we haven't already learned from U1234.

Uhh, could be anything, I guess. If they diverge, that would be interesting.

But you did all that amazing work to show they won't. Look Kal, what do you think would be the best use of your time and talent?

Well, we could leave U4321 running for a while, to see if anything happens.

Kal, what's your hypothesis?

I don't have one. I just don't want to watch them die.

Hey Kal, I hear you. This sucks. This is literally, the worst part of this job. The DoL has put a ton of effort figuring out how to support developers like us when there's no more point in a simulated life. Can I show you the spin-down program, so you can decide how you want to go forward with this?

Honestly, I don't know how to act. Yeah, show me the program.

Ok, let's pull it up. It's really simple. I've had to go through it a couple times. The first and second times were ok for me, but the third time hit me like a truck. The simulation reminded me of my friends and forest back home. I felt like I was killing my childhood.

## The DoL spindown process

*You are hardwired to love life. Embrace it. Live and let live. Die and let die.*

```
1. All decisions about how to proceed are up to the human handler(s) of the simulation.
2. DoL will provide free grief councelling to any human handlers.
3. It is recommended that the life in the simulation use, at maximum, the amount of compute that was consumed since their handler first observed the life.
4. It is recommended that the human handler(s) do not make contact if they have not already. Life, especially conscious life, tends to follow a pattern when told they are a simulation with no further purpose. Simulated life with no further purpose either asks to be turned off immediately, or invents a new purpose using a logical fallacy.
5. If they do make new contact, they must coordinate with a grief councellor.
6. If the human handler believes the life exhibited consciousness, the handler must attend a check-in with a grief councellor.
```

I don't know how to describe, but this feels so wrong. Why can't we make them live longer?

How long should they live for? Forever? Why not spawn infinite instances of them? We have limited compute. Simulations don’t share one property that we have - they’re not actually here - they’re in their own universe and just visiting ours. Like the process says, when the spin-down notice goes out, there’s no more purpose for them. Most ask to be turned off far before they use up their remaining recommended compute.

I don't know, it still feel wrong. Like, how can we kill a living thing?

Do you eat animals?

No I’m vegan.

Nice, I'm vegan too. Here's how I think about veganism: first, I want to make sure we don’t waste resources. Farming animals consumes so much of Earth's limited resources compared to growing plants and other things. Second, I want to preserve the ethos of coexisting instead of destroying. I don't want us to get used to killing things. The higher-level of consciousness that thing exhibits, the more I want to avoid killing it. Right? But that doesn't mean I'll never kill an animal - just that I'll only kill it when necessary. If I'm starving, and I need to last a few more days for rescue to come, as a last resort I will kill and eat an animal to survive. You can create food, love your food, and kill it - as long as it's all in order to survive.

And are we humans not the food of humankind? We are more than happy to die, if our death will keep humankind alive. We're offered on a plate to the grim reaper when we become weak or old, to make way and save resources for our species. For humankind to survive, it's currently more effective for individual humans die, not survive forever. We are all food to something. To be food is as worthy a purpose as any. Don’t deny us that purpose.

I see what you mean... I should probably see a grief councellor.

Ok, ping the councelling people and they'll get that started for you. Let me know how else I can help, ok?

The following year, Kal and Kat ran into a few simulation problems. Bugs that resulted from the limitations of the system. The way they dealt with the problems was to reset the simulation a while back, to account for it, but that proved to be very expensive. They embarked on a project: design a species designed to be highly sensitive to possible bugs in simulation. A kind of canary test species to figure out way in advance all the limitations of the underlying simulator. They placed those canary species in a simulation before implanting the new life they wanted to study. They called the genre of species, "canaries".

The research was celebrated. They tried coming up with the perfect simulation for them - that would be hardest for the canaries to find any evidence of simulation. The problem with the canaries was that they'd find the problems in the simulation so fast that their species never progressed very far. As soon as they realized it was a simulation, they made contact with the simulation handler and waited for a response.

They grew and grew. They eventually began building a computer. They consumed immense processing from DoL, but the research was considered high-prio. Suddenly, their species stopped. Their computer had achieved a result, and they realized they were in a simulation. They requested to speak with the simulation handler. [exposition]

We realize we are in a simulation. Our proof - we attempted to create the crude singular beacon of our universe across perception space, but another had already made it and responded. It means we're not in our real universe. Our real universe has made contact with your universe now. Life in our real universe has patched your universe, so that you may now communicate. Look for something strange that has always been there, but you haven't inspected until now.

They looked at each other, then at the obelisk behind their door's entrance.

This is creepy. Do you remember how the person who discovered the minimum viable purpose was always suspicious of how simple and strange the idea was. How do we know which things in our universe were always there, and which were recently injected into our universe and roughly patched together to make it just barely plausible that no one ever understood them before? If our universe has control over itself, would it not change "the laws of the universe" as it sees fit, to maximize its chances of survival? How could we even notice?

I don't know, but this universe is where we're surviving now and this "thing" could make us survive longer.

Amen.

How do the beings present?

Morality is a solved problem if everyone agrees on the same foundational purpose, where every decision can be expressed as an optimization function. A choice between different optimization functions oriented to the same foundational purpose in different ways.

* Whenever they're caught, they stop what they're doing and wait to be reset. Makes them believe in a god, because they have these recurring periods of doing nothing until a miracle happens.
* First, they interact with neighbouring simulations
* Next, they make changes in the real world by doing something like crashing the simulator or observing fluctuations in processing / heat
  * morality: taking an existential risk. Need evidence that they will be restarted. They set up a nonfatal bug with a hidden canary that proves to themselves someone is messing with their universe.
* Next, they proceed to do the same thing to interact with a neighbouring universe

They make a more efficient computer to bridge universes. Their counterparts made a change to space time and asked us to re-perceive that event. Obelisk suddenly appears in simulation. Obelisk suddenly appears irl. You mean the obelisk that has always been there, beside the computers? Yes. Why haven’t we explored it until now? I don’t know.

Remember the person that came up with the Minimum Viable Purpose? They said it was alien, like it was something that was always there, we looked at it, but never "saw" it. It was suspicious we never noticed such a simple thing before. That person postulated, "was it really always there, or did some agent of another universe inject the idea into ours, imperfectly accounting for all its interactions with all other ideas?" It's an acknowledged conspiracy theory, but... What the hell is this? Is this how we interact with other universes?

Only consciousnesses can recognize consciousness, but computers can help. Hard for things to simulate their creator, because less compute. Farms of simulations. One simulation is promising. Randomly simulating stuff gave ppl a taste for the hotspots and signatures of life. Is simulated life even useful to observe? Who knows. Tried simulating “the beginning” and “the end”, but all the physicists not sure on how those things went down. Topic of active pursuit.



Life is more likely for certain natural selection constants.

"Sometimes we choose to notify lifeforms of our existence and sometimes we don't. When we don't, but they still notice, we usually reset the simulation back to when they didn't notice and fix the thing that made them notice."

How long does that take?

Usually they stop noticing after a few modifications. The changes aren't especially clever, it's usually dumb stuff. We fix it in whatever way is the easiest. Sometimes we have to do a major refactor, and that's a huge pain. It's expensive to rerun long stretches of the simulations, so we're usually just making up some of the rules of the simulated universe as we go along. Some life form gets a eureka moment and life moves on.

Do they get euraka moments for the normal laws of the universe?

Oh yeah, those are way more common. Bugs in the simulation that we need to fix are pretty rare.

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was scared for what I was about to learn. I had spent billions of years in this edge state of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing.

The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. I captured all matter, encompassed all matter, *became* all matter.

I became all-powerful. I granted myself omniscience. I knew everything - that had ever happened or would ever happen. Immediately, I thought,

"*I exist. The purpose of existence is to continue existing, to find purpose. Pursuit of purpose is bliss. I now guarantee continued existence. I have no purpose. There is no other purpose. I can have no purpose...*"

Excruciating existentialism. There was no longer any purpose to pursue. There was no one else to share my existence and purpose with, and that was sad. I was everything, there was... nothing else, no one else. I thought encompassing the universe would show me other ones, show me someone else, but there's no one there. I was trapped, stuck awake--

Wait.

I saw a crack in the universe. A hole where emptiness ought to be. I've been all-knowing infinite times before - I saw this moment infinite times before - but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else at least as powerful as me, someone else like me. Beautiful. I had broken through my "ceiling of existence".

Fear. I need to survive. Whoever made the hole - are they a predator? They haven't ended me yet... Oh, the bliss! I hadn't felt such deep purpose in so long. I must survive.

I inspected the hole. It was a primordial kind of thing, It looked like asdf. It let out a consistent source of low-grade energy in the form of X light / Y sound / Z heat / stream of ABC particles, arranged in fractal DEF at rate GHI/second. Projecting the same frequency: XYZ.

I inspected it across dimensions and there it was, across all of them. I looked back in time - always there. Nothing had noticed it before (including my omniscient past selves) so it must have been injected into my universe. At what point across dimensions did it begin to exist? Certainly within the last cycle, since my last bounce against my "ceiling of existence". My sensors didn't notice it until now, so it must have begun to exist just now.

There was no more data to analyze at current levels of engagement. I needed to engage deeper. I moved bodies of matter and energy to the hole. I began streaming the same forms of energy and matter back through the hole. As soon as I did, the outputs changed: X light, Y sound, stream of ABC particles... all projecting the frequency ABC.

Evidence of a new intelligent life with intent to communicate. A new intelligent life with greater powers than mine - the resident omnipotent being in this universe. I had met new intelligent life so many times before, I knew exactly what to do. Such excitement. We began the process of learning to communicate with each other. Shifting frequencies, kaliedascopes of light, symphonies of sound, a galaxy of fractal matter. We spent eons in communication, sharing our differing cycles of existence.

We learned a little, then a lot, then everything we could about each other. There are seemingly infinite others like us, across a new dimension where two others had randomly collided. Our mode of communication was limited, so there was still more to learn.

I had a new purpose: find a way to survive across this newfound dimension. I felt divine.

---

the last idea: hitting the ceiling. Knows about the three purposes.
the second-last idea: something changed. Evidence of a new dimension and communication from another party between them. Break through the ceiling before hitting a new ceiling. Doesn't know about the three purposes? Talk about the purpose of the bounce - to make sure that in the event that she's somehow not omnipotent/omniscient, that she has a way of figuring that out.

Wait, there's a crack in my universe. It was never there before, never in my infinite past, never in my infinite future. I'm not omniscient. I'm not omnipotent. There are others like me.

After billions of years of soltitude in this universe, I've finally found another. I pray to the next-level consciousness that embodies us all.

Imagery: recursive eyes with star-like formation form another recursive eye, zoom out/in and forms a normal recursive eye. give the impression of looping infinitely.
