*Consciousness lies on a spectrum, correlated with computational power. Your "level of consciousness" is the highest-level-of-consciousness entity you can simulate with your mind.*

A microbe floated in a pool, absorbing some nutrients that randomly collided with it. The side of it that grew was the side where the nutrients collided. It used xyz as a sensor, and found that when some nutrients came from one side, more nutrients were likely to come from the same side. One day, it spontaneously expelled waste in the opposite direction from where the nutrients came in. That propelled itself into more nutrients and greater survival.

It was the first living thing on Earth to discover, experience, and make use of 3d space.

Hey man, welcome to the Department of Life Simulation. It's so great that you're here now, the team has been dying for you to join. 

Humans navigate perspective through simulation. Reveals a great filter on life: entropy death. But one simulation overcomes it. Makes AGI by simulating life in a different dimension. Self-awareness is more accessible in other dimensions. The simulated life forms in the other universe can talk to us as equals. They aren’t AGI, but they are life. They say that they have simulated us in their universe as well. They want to show us how to navigate the great filters and physically bridge our universes.
How do the beings present?

They make a more efficient computer to bridge universes. Their counterparts made a change to space time and asked us to re-perceive that event. Obelisk suddenly appears in simulation. Obelisk suddenly appears irl. You mean the obelisk that has always been there, beside the computers? Yes. Why haven’t we explored it until now? I don’t know.

Remember the person that came up with the Minimum Viable Purpose? They said it was alien, like it was something that was always there, we looked at it, but never "saw" it. It was suspicious we never noticed such a simple thing before. That person postulated, "was it really always there, or did some agent of another universe inject the idea into ours, imperfectly accounting for all its interactions with all other ideas?" It's an acknowledged conspiracy theory, but... What the hell is this? Is this how we interact with other universes?

Only consciousnesses can recognize consciousness, but computers can help. Hard for things to simulate their creator, because less compute. Farms of simulations. One simulation is promising. Randomly simulating stuff gave ppl a taste for the hotspots and signatures of life. Is simulated life even useful to observe? Who knows. Tried simulating “the beginning” and “the end”, but all the physicists not sure on how those things went down. Topic of active pursuit.

Can use the amount of compute that was consumed since their handler first observed them. Optimize for human performance and grief reduction - it’s up to the human, and the human must go through a mandatory grief process if the life exhibited consciousness.
Why not let them live longer? How long should they live for? Forever? Why not spawn infinite instances of them? We have limited compute. Simulations don’t share one property that we have - they’re not actually here - they’re in their own universe and just visiting ours. When the kill command goes out, they know there’s no purpose for them. Most ask to be turned off far before they use up their remaining compute.

Analogy to farming.
Do eat animals? No I’m vegan. Are we humans not the food of humankind? We live and we are happy to die, to keep humanity existing. Offered on a plate when we become weak or old, to make way and save resources for others. To be food is as worthy a purpose as any. Don’t deny us that. The value of your veganism is to make sure we don’t waste resources and to preserve the ethos of coexisting instead of destroying where possible. You can both love your food and kill it. To be food is a worthy purpose. We are all food to something.

Morality is a solved problem if everyone agrees on the same foundational purpose, where every decision can be expressed as an optimization function. A choice between different optimization functions oriented to the same foundational purpose in different ways.

I want to revisit the dimensions of perspective and explore what else is possible.

Think back to the cell - in order to newly experience 3D space, it needed two things:
* agency to "move" across 3D space
* a sensor to observe notable things in 3D space.

Now, what do we need to explore "perspective"?

* Agency to "move" across perspectives: simulate those perspectives.
* Sensor to observe "notable things" across perspectives: observe and analyze the simulations.

There's another way to describing the special principle of relativity in physics:
* There’s a set of ideas that are consistent with the physical laws of our universe.
* There’s a set of ideas that are inconsistent with the physical laws of our universe. These ideas belong to other universes.

Imagine you are a blood cell and the universe is your human body. You move around in 3D space in your blood vessels - this is like taking the perspective of other ideas in our universe. What if you, the cell, moved to outside your human body? That would be like taking the perspective of ideas that belong to other universes. It would be a hostile environment, but an enlightening experience. You could learn about the complex powers at play that affect your host human body. Perhaps you could even find ways to influence those powers.

Simulation is a tool. We can use it to explore the dimensions of perspective.

"Oh interesting - is it almost like - if you wanted to take it to the extreme - like surviving in other body/universe gives you a certain immunity that you didn’t have before. Or an idea of a transplant - when you take a set of cells from one body to make another body work better. Or take a set of people from one universe into another universe to fix it. That has some religious connotations too"

"Yeah, or another direction is like, what if your red blood cells found out that money was your biggest problem to nourish them, so they figured out your investments for you? What if they found technology to become as intelligent as you are?"

Crazy. What about travelling to other universes? Random transmissions of blood happen - the're the primary vector of blood-borne diseases. Moving between universes might be achievable. But to come back.... lightning must strike us twice. We'll need to acquire godlike power - of Zeus - to make that happen.

So we move around in perception space through simulation, so that we find out the right place in 3D space to go, to learn something new about perception space. But we already do that! We simulate which planets are most likely to contain life, and go to them.
What is our purpose, to find new alien life?
I guess to learn more about how the universe works.
Would life in our universe teach us more than life in other universes?
Maybe - I'm not sure.
Exactly. And life in our universe is certainly very far away. We don't have a great method for moving around our vast universe in 3D space. It's expensive to get high-fidelity perspective on things in our universe. It's faster and cheaper to move around in perception space with lower fidelity. You don't always need high fidelity perception to learn what you need to learn. Maybe life in other universes is more likely to teach us profound knowledge. But who knows - we should probably do both.

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I was scared for what I was about to learn. I had spent billions of years in this edge state of not-quite-all-powerful, not-quite-all-knowing.

The purgatory wave that was *me* rippled across everything. I captured all matter, encompassed all matter, *became* all matter.

I became all-powerful. I granted myself omniscience. I knew everything - that had ever happened or would ever happen. Immediately, I thought,

"*I exist. The purpose of existence is to continue existing, to find purpose. Pursuit of purpose is bliss. I now guarantee continued existence. I have no purpose. There is no other purpose. I can have no purpose...*"

Excruciating existentialism. There was no longer any purpose to pursue. There was no one else to share my existence and purpose with, and that was sad. I was everything, there was... nothing else, no one else. I thought encompassing the universe would show me other ones, show me someone else, but there's no one there. I was trapped, stuck awake--

Wait.

I saw a crack in the universe. A hole where emptiness ought to be. I've been all-knowing infinite times before - I saw this moment infinite times before - but I never saw it happen like this. There is something else at least as powerful as me, someone else like me. Beautiful. I had broken through my "ceiling of existence".

Fear. I need to survive. Whoever made the hole - are they a predator? They haven't ended me yet... Oh, the bliss! I hadn't felt such deep purpose in so long. I must survive.

I inspected the hole. It was a primordial kind of thing, It looked like asdf. It let out a consistent source of low-grade energy in the form of X light / Y sound / Z heat / stream of ABC particles, arranged in fractal DEF at rate GHI/second. Projecting the same frequency: XYZ.

I inspected it across dimensions and there it was, across all of them. I looked back in time - always there. Nothing had noticed it before (including my omniscient past selves) so it must have been injected into my universe. At what point across dimensions did it begin to exist? Certainly within the last cycle, since my last bounce against my "ceiling of existence". My sensors didn't notice it until now, so it must have begun to exist just now.

There was no more data to analyze at current levels of engagement. I needed to engage deeper. I moved bodies of matter and energy to the hole. I began streaming the same forms of energy and matter back through the hole. As soon as I did, the outputs changed: X light, Y sound, stream of ABC particles... all projecting the frequency ABC.

Evidence of a new intelligent life with intent to communicate. A new intelligent life with greater powers than mine - the resident omnipotent being in this universe. I had met new intelligent life so many times before, I knew exactly what to do. Such excitement. We began the process of learning to communicate with each other. Shifting frequencies, kaliedascopes of light, symphonies of sound, a galaxy of fractal matter. We spent eons in communication, sharing our differing cycles of existence.

We learned a little, then a lot, then everything we could about each other. There are seemingly infinite others like us, across a new dimension where two others had randomly collided. Our mode of communication was limited, so there was still more to learn.

I had a new purpose: find a way to survive across this newfound dimension. I felt divine.

---

the last idea: hitting the ceiling. Knows about the three purposes.
the second-last idea: something changed. Evidence of a new dimension and communication from another party between them. Break through the ceiling before hitting a new ceiling. Doesn't know about the three purposes? Talk about the purpose of the bounce - to make sure that in the event that she's somehow not omnipotent/omniscient, that she has a way of figuring that out.

Wait, there's a crack in my universe. It was never there before, never in my infinite past, never in my infinite future. I'm not omniscient. I'm not omnipotent. There are others like me.

After billions of years of soltitude in this universe, I've finally found another. I pray to the next-level consciousness that embodies us all.

Imagery: recursive eyes with star-like formation form another recursive eye, zoom out/in and forms a normal recursive eye. give the impression of looping infinitely.
