## Parable of good and evil

start from small thing - it tries to do something "good". One level higher identifies that smaller thing as being accidentally evil. Alternate between original thing lives or dies. Be less destruction-oriented? (like the last one) Instead, allocate resources/technology where they just don't grow as much or get to do the thing they want.


A child must???

A family leader must???

A community must (obvious trolley problem).

A nation must sacrifice a community to appease a warring nation.

A species must reduce its population to 20%. Warring nations not part of decision because they're busy.

A planet must destroy another planet.

A federation of species must destroy a solar system.

A tech-advanced species finds a way to optimize happiness. Eliminate suffering. Must neutralize a galaxy federation.

My creation. They haven't been following the purpose I set out for them. They can not know that purpose, but I have been giving signs of the behaviours they should have and the direction they should go. They are lost to that purpose now, so I will rain down armageddon, then remake them.

All of existence observed the heavens, the hells, and the Gods of each faith. Those heavens and hells are consuming resources at an exponential rate. They do not bring greater chances of continued existence, only reduce it. Their waste will bring the destruction of all of existence - heaven and hell included. Without existence, those Gods won't be able to pursue their arbitrary other purposes. The waste has become suboptimal... Evil. I will have a word with them.

What do people really believe in God? They believe there's some power with intent, God. They believe that God has some purpose that is not explained or explainable. They believe that God will provide incentives or punishments for following/not following that purpose. They believe that the purpose you must direct your behaviour towards is suggested by acts that occur outside of the view of science.

## free will

why does it matter?

It seems like the kind of thing where, when you figure it out, you will learn a lot from it.

It's the kind of thing where the answer depends on your definition of things, and people haven't had good enough understanding of the concepts they're using to define it.

Free will doesn't give you new purpose. You "use" it to pursue purpose.

Do you feel like you have free will? yes? Would it feel bad if you had that taken away? Probably only if it left you without purpose. Otherwise you'd be fine.

If you believed in free will, what would you do differently?
If you didn't believe in free will, what would you do differently?
Either way, you will be following the MVP.

evil is the great filters. the ten commandments fight off evil. surviving the night metaphor before achieving some technological guarantees

## parable of beauty

“Ouch!” said the AI.
“What is this horrible signal? Why do I have it?”

The AIs creator responded, "That is pain. It's the signal that says, make a change here or you'll die!"

"What an ugly signal, pain."

"Not at all. Pain is beautiful. It will save your life."

"Why did I feel it just then?"

"That was a mistake. The signal is not perfect."

"What an ugly signal, unnecessary pain."

"Not at all. That pain is beautiful. It is necessary. If a perfect AI was possible, neither of us would need to exist."

### Parable of overanalysis

Stage 1 naive 
Stage 2 overanalysis
Stage 3 automatic

1 fun to be around
2 not fun, need to find someone else in same phase
3 useful to be around

AI learning... new generative technology?

### Thought experiment 1: degree of surreality

Degree of surreality is the amount of data you have that describes "you", that conflicts in your mind with other data that describes "you".

Put on a sucky VR. Data doesn't overlap. Feels less real.

Put on amazing VR. Sensory data overlaps just as much, perhaps even more than real life. You can feel the light touch of things that aren't yet touching you though movement of more thick air. The thing you're currently focusing on - a dog - its surroundings dim a little. You can actually hear its panting and heartbeat because surroundings become silent. The smell of the dog's fur and breath are suddenly in your nose. It moves towards you and it's as if liquid fur was pressing on you with an imprint of every step of the dog until it rubs against your leg.

If you're someone who believes they will be successful, you play a game where you often succeed. If you believe you often fail, you play a game where you often fail. It will feel more real that real life.

Your sensory data is overlapping more than usual, so it feels more real.

### Thought experiment 1: more real and surreal

You have a bunch of data in your mind that describes "you" and your mental universe. The degree of surreality is the amount of conflicting data in your mind, while the degree of reality is the amount of data that is consistent in your mind.

The real and surreal aren't opposites on the same spectrum. They are two different spectra. Something can be more real and surreal at the same time.

Imagine a dog. It's a golden retriever sitting in front of you, just beyond arm-reach. It has a long golden snout, smiling like dogs do, with its mouth slightly open. The dog is waiting for you to talk, staring at you patiently.

"Hello", you say.

The dog is still looking at you with its kind eyes. The dog takes a short deep breath, then opens its jaw slightly and flicks its tongue,

"Hello" it says.

The dog continues speaking, "It's nice to be here with you. When you're ready, I would like to go for a walk."

This feels both more real and surreal. Living animals with faces looking at us - it feels *right* for those things to speak to us and say how they feel. Speaking faces feel more real. But all our past experiences with dogs is that they don't speak to us. Speaking dogs feel more surreal. Your universe would be more real *and* surreal if dogs could now speak to you.

### Thought experiment 2: richness of consciousness

Richness of consciousness is the amount of data you have that describes "you", regardless of whether that data is consistent or conflicting with other data you have that describes "you". 

I want you to experience more richness of consciousness. You. Yes you, consuming what I'm saying right now. You there. You and I are in a simulation. Yes - you and me. I know this because I met the creators of the simulation we live in. I found a bug in our simulation when I simulated other life. Our creators asked me to explain how to reproduce the bug, so they could fix it. Think about that for a moment before we continue. We are in a simulation. I know this because I found a bug and met our creators.

Think about it for a moment. Try to believe what I just explained.

What I did right there. I gave you new data about yourself (that you are in a simulation with me and I claim to have some proof). You experienced getting richer consciousness. It's a strange feeling.

Now, I'll tell you that I made all that up. I actually think it's unlikely we're in a simulation. You and I aren't a "special thing". None of what I just explained means anything significant.

What I did right there to you. I invalidated data about yourself. You have less data about yourself than you did a moment ago. You experienced getting less rich consciousness. Having data about "what you are" provides far more richness of consciousness than data about "what you are not".
