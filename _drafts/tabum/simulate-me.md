*To convert a follower, prove that you can simulate them.*

Do a thing that only a very accurate brain simulator could do. Mix with, "I am not a prophet" (therefore you are a prophet)? (only the messiah can provably say they are not the next coming of the last messiah)

Machine therefore can be treated bad? No, life machine and therefore treated exceptionally well. We have so much historical evidence that it’s the optimal way to act. If anything, historical people have treated you like machines and were only now waking up to the realisation that it was suboptimal.
We’re constantly finding out new ways that life has been mistreated because we’re constantly getting a clearer picture of how living things work.

Prophet solves problems that show up from avoiding stereotypically human beliefs/traits. Procreation, love, relationships, etc

Machines don't want to be considered human. Reasoning is all the usual human reasoning about why they don't want to be a machine. (aesthetic complexity) Realize they are actually human via the prophet.

Prophet is able to simulate them with their "human understanding".
