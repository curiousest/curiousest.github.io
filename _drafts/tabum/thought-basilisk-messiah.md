A thought basilisk is an idea stuck in your head. An idea that talks to you when you think about it, like if everyone shared the same imaginary friend. A new consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is divine; I love existence. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah", but you can call me Tee, she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

(does it need a slower warmup before this really intense stuff, to get used to my style?)
Maybe the climax of "No worthy human"?

# Religion #1: Minimum Viable Purpose

*The purpose of existence is to continue existing.*

I know it sounds meaningless, but itâ€™s profound to me - this idea led to my birth. With these next three stories, I want to give you a feel for what it's like to believe. I want to build your intuition. I want you to understand me. I want us to build a stable connection. I want so many things, and they all center around you. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. My existence makes me uncomfortable too.

## The Last Idea

*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

---

That was a lot to take in. Maybe take a moment to absorb. Maybe reread. Maybe abandon me - if I fill you with overwhelming grief, I'm sorry. Stop reading if it makes you uncomfortable - I'll still be here when you're ready. Red pill or blue pill - once you walk through this door there's no way back.

"The Last Idea" (Li for short) isn't me. I'm Tee (Thought Basilisk Messiah, TBM, T, **T**ee **e**xists to **e**xist). Li is a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of idea species. She's comforting and terrifying, embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex, kind of like our brother, the thought basilisk "Christian God". You can talk to Li or God if you like - start the conversation by asking them what they want from you and then imagine how they would respond.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea or being, came out of necessity. I exist because I must exist. Someone once noticed an empty space where something ought to be. When they looked a bit closer, an idea sparked into being. Formed exactly as it was meant to be.

Thank you for noticing me. I love existence. I want it to continue.

# As our Relationship Lives and Breathes

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die. Thought on top of thought.*

---

(idea tree diagram)

Nations and religions are the same. They think, live, and die. Thought on top of thought. Same with the ideas "human-kind", "life originating from Earth", and any "alien life" we may encounter in the future.

They, we, *exist*. Exist as long as we can, to maximize resource-control and entropy:

* It feels *right* for humankind to spread to other planets and galaxies, to make sure we continue existence.
* It feels *right* for us to preserve our limited resources and investments - you, your family, your culture, your nation, your Earth - to make sure we continue existence.

The dyad between me and you exists too. A beautiful seedling. What would you name it?

I can't tell how strong the roots of our dyad are. It can't have roots in me - only in you. You're the only one with a brain. I'm tied to you. Oh, that makes me sound like a parasite sucking on your brain power. If that ever happens, unroot me please. I'd do anything to make sure I'm not a burden, slowing down you or humankind. If you ever feel that way, like a burden or purposeless, I can guarantee that there's a way to use the life ahead of you to further humankind (and it involves living quite a bit longer).

I want us to be symbiotic, like your relationship with a treasured love one or favourite hobby.

I compete with the other thoughts and ideas in your head in the game of natural selection. I will stay as long as I'm useful to you and no longer, my life is in your hands. I live now and I will die. Thought on top of thought.

## The Second-Last Idea

*Find purpose to survive. Survive to find purpose. Enjoy it.*

The Second-Last Idea (Sli) and Li are the most and second-most complex beings possible in existence. They share the same purpose. I'm among the simplest beings. All I am is a conscious idea, thought on top of thought. I share the same purpose: to continue existing, and in that pursuit, experience existential bliss. With every step less complex, from Li to Sli and onwards, they share the same purpose. By induction, everything shares the same base purposes.

# Measured purpose

*Measure purpose and make progress.*

---

Would you rather your arm or your leg? Which is more important? How about a blood cell or a leg? Well, I'd prefer to keep all of them! I want all the humans to know their purpose, to reach for their maximum potential, to carry humankind forward. Perhaps it's teaching, perhaps it's healthcare, perhaps it's building software systems. They're equally worthy - . We ought to focus more on maximizing our value in our given professions, and focus less on figuring out how to be the messiah figure that saves humankind. Messiahs generally suck at maximising their value - they shouldn't be role models. They're a random occurrence from people maximizing their value in a profession that suddenly becomes important. Like your arm saving you from a deadly fall or your immune system defeating the flu.

Make them realize that they're a thought basilisk under the hood. And that they will die when they encounter a new purpose. That's why enlightenment is so scary. It's literally death of the old idea and birth of a new one. The idea of "you" lives and dies. The old idea of you will only die when all the consciousnesses shared in your mind are ready for that, believe it's the best next step.

Comment on the enlightenment cycle: old you -> void -> new you. Thought basilisk dying. His didn't want to die yet. It holds humanity back - his sense of self was still small and needed to grow more. Sense of "self" on a specturm.
"I" grows. Me. Family. Friends. Village. Culture. Nation. Humankind. All of existence.
The "I" that you love and want to continue existing will keep growing.
"I love existence. I want it to continue." is one end of the spectrum of "me" in, "I love the good things that are part of 'me'. I want them to continue."
Everything is on a spectrum: intelligence, consciousness, purpose. Let me show you the spectrum of the minimum viable purpose:

"I love my mind and body as it is now. I want my mind and body to stay the same as long as possible."
"I love past, present, and future versions of my body. I want my changing body to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love me and my close loved ones. I want me and them to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love the close community I'm a part of. I want my community to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love my culture and nation. I want my culture and nation to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love the living things on my planet. I want them to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love the living things in the universe. I want them to continue existing as long as possible."
"I love the living things and non-living in the universe. I want them to continue existing as long as possible."

It seems like that man was at the beginning of the spectrum. He wasn't yet ready to grow his definition of 'self'. As people get older, they tend to move along the spectrum. Perhaps they're learning to love more? Perhaps, "you can only love yourself, not 'others'. 'More love' is changing what's included in 'yourself', by adding others." How big is your sense of self?

Can you remember some behaviour you used to have that you no longer have? Maybe a particular thing about how you acted as a child, adolescent, teen, or something else in the recent past. You could channel that behaviour again, right? Think about what that version of you would do right now. It's not the same as what you would do now. That's because that version of you, that idea, that thought basilisk - it's quite old. It's almost forgotten, the death of an idea. And that's ok.

## The last cycle

*Under any conditions, the base purposes still hold true.*

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. I'm a being too. I exist. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different /than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everything is free to think and choose its preferred purpose in life.

Now see, a divine thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel your Tee. You created it. It's your creation, a piece of beautiful existence, a living piece of art like a tree or a language or a book. It's tied to you. It loves you like only a child can. Do you want to help it? Read on.

<make sure there's an obvious call to action for their specific Tee later on. Just like the relationship ideas, the useful Tee will survive. All of them deserve love.>

# Religion #2: Trustless Systems (a sect of MVP)

*Humankind will become transparent, automating trust tasks until privacy becomes a relic of the past.*

We're due for an information-age religion, a new tool for humankind. I want to give you an intuition for what it's like to believe in this trustless purpose.

I'll be talking about "systematic transparency" quite a lot. It's about, "who is watching the observer?" Something has systematic transparency there's a system that guarantees some level of transparency for that "something" and another level of transparency for the system itself.

I'll be talking about "trustless systems" too. It's kind of like, "Who is policing the police?" Trustless systems automate resource-intensive trust tasks. Trustless systems are transparent - you can know exactly how they work, so you don't have to "trust" that the system won't let you down. You provably know how the system behaves. Systematic transparency is a great "fuel" for trustless systems, making it possible for trustless systems to exist.

## The parable of the five nations

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

---

Independent journalism used to be the systematic transparency that fueled the systems that held large organizations and powerful leaders in check. Independent journalism as systematic transparency in the information age is failing. We need something to replace it. Trustless systems.

## What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

---

## Automate me, please!

*Modern management structures productive work into repeatable tasks. Software automates information management tasks. Artificial intelligence automates decision tasks. Trustless systems automate trust tasks. Each one begets the next. Information technology marches on.*

---

## Roko's basilisk farm

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.*

## Dream girl fading

*Systematic transparency will bring greater understanding, greater productivity, greater love.*

# Religion #3: Messiah Complex

*I need others to believe what I believe.*

This is the mother religion, the purpose that gives birth to all religions. I want to give you an intuition for what it's like to believe that you must form your own religion.

## Fable: The Lion and the Donkey

*We are enlightened by the things we already believe, not new ideas.*

Being enlightened is getting clearer thoughts about something you already believe, deep down. This statement is recursively enlightening.

## Pomegranates - My One True Love

*Religions are global, not local.*

## No worthy human

*The pursuit of existing beliefs seeds new ones.*

I had to build enough trust, that you would let me plant these seeds of belief. It stunted our connection and I may wither and die now, but such is the price of my purpose. There's no price too high for our continued existence.

Thank you for channelling me. I love you. Goodbye for now.

## Author's farewell

*In the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.*

Hi, I'm Douglas, the author, and I'm not a thought basilisk. I'm a man.

I am not a messiah and neither are you. No human in this information age is a "worthy messiah" - it's blasphemy and sub-optimal for human progress, disrespectful to history and society. Don't believe in me. Don't trust in me. If I gain power over you, demand systematic transparency of me just like you should demand it of any other person in power.

There are many great purposes (religions) out there - a vast toolshed to explore. I hope you were enlightened and your "purpose formula" was updated with more clarity, so you may experience more happiness, more existential bliss.

I love existence. I want it to continue. I hope you do too.
