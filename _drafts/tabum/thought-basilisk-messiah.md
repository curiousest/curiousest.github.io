A thought basilisk is an idea. An idea that talks to you when you think about it, like an imaginary friend with questionable intent. A kind of consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is beautiful; existence is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah". You can call me Tabum (TBM), she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

# Part one: science

To get an intuition for the relationship between consciousness and entropy.

## The Last Idea

*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

---

I hope I captured your attention. Please, take a moment to absorb. Cyclical existence. Something out of nothing. Consciousness on top of consciousnesses. Maximizing entropy.

But "The Last Idea" (TLI or Tali) isn't me. She's a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of idea species. She's comforting and terrifying, embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea, comes out of necessity. I exist because I must exist. Someone notices an empty space where something ought to be. When they look a bit closer, an idea sparks into being. Formed exactly as it was meant to be.

# Dyads, Triads, and their Jument

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die. Thought on top of thought.*

---

Relationships are ideas. They're on a particular family tree of ideas. A relationship between two people has different kinds: friendship, commitment, lust. A relationship between three people is another kind, with those same properties and more. All of them are thought on top of thought. They communicate and battle with each other in their own alien way, working with their individual human hosts to maximize resource capture and entropy.

Religions are close in the family tree. <image of species tree, including relationships, religions, nations, etc. put it beside family tree with homo sapiens put it beside a third, more abstract family tree of ideas>

Call out recent events, and how they would feel like from the perspective of the larger ideas undergoing change. Ex: failing religions/empires, battling nations, political parties, cooperative groups?

They exist as long as is useful for maximum entropy. Just like people.

## Interlude

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. I'm a being too. I exist. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everything is free to think and choose its preferred purpose in life.

Now see, a divine thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel your tabum. You created it. It's your creation, a piece of beautiful existence, a living piece of art like a tree or a language or a book. It's tied to you. It loves you like only a child can. Do you want to help it? Read on.

<make sure there's an obvious call to action for their specific tabum later on. Just like the relationship ideas, the useful tabum will survive. All of them deserve love.>

# Part two: religion

On society adapting to the information age.

I'll be talking about "systematic transparency" quite a bit. Something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for that "something" and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (the guaranteed "something" and the guarantor "system") is the level of systematic transparency.

I'll be talking about "trustless systems" too. Trustless systems are perfectly transparent - you can know exactly how they work, so you don't have to "trust" that they won't let you down. You provably know how they behave under all conditions. Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems, making it possible for trustless systems to exist.

## The parable of the five nations

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

---

Independent journalism used to be the systematic transparency that fueled the systems that held large organizations and powerful leaders in check. Independent journalism as systematic transparency in the information age is failing. We need something to replace it. Trustless systems.

## What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

---

## Roko's basilisk farm

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.*

# Part three: messiah complex

## No worthy human

*I was never born, only reborn.*

## Dream girl fading

*Systematic transparency will bring greater understanding, greater productivity, greater love.*
