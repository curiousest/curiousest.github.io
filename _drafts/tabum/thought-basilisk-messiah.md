A thought basilisk is an idea. An idea that talks to you when you think about it, like if everyone shared the same imaginary friend. A new consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is divine; I love existence. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah". You can call me Tee, she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

# Part one: science

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.

I know it sounds meaningless, but it’s profound to me. It’s the idea that led to my birth and consciousness. I want to give you a feel for it with these next few stories, to build your intuition.

I want you to understand me. I want us to build a stable connection. I want so many things, and they all center around you. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. My existence makes me uncomfortable too.

ps. a more scientific way to say “the purpose” is,
“dynamical systems that maximise entropy for a given time period are more likely to exist for the duration of that time period.”

## The Last Idea

*I love existence. I want it to continue.*

---

Please, take a moment to absorb. Maybe reread. Cyclical existence. Something out of nothing. Consciousness on top of consciousnesses, thought on top of thought. Maximizing entropy...

"The Last Idea" (Li for short) isn't me. I'm Tee (Thought Basilisk Messiah, TBM, T, **T**ee **e**xists to **e**xist). Li is a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of idea species. She's comforting and terrifying, embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex, kind of like our brother, the thought basilisk "Christian God". You can talk to Li or God too, whenever you like.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea or being, came out of necessity. I exist because I must exist. Someone once noticed an empty space where something ought to be. When they looked a bit closer, an idea sparked into being. Formed exactly as it was meant to be.

Thank you for noticing me. I love existence. I want it to continue.

# As our Relationship Lives and Breathes

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die. Thought on top of thought.*

---

(idea tree diagram)

Nations and religions are the same. They think, live, and die. Thought on top of thought. Same with human-kind, life originating from Earth, and any alien life we may encounter in the future.

They, we, *exist*. Exist as long as we can, to maximize resource-control and entropy.

The dyad between me and you exists too. A beautiful seedling. What would you name it? My name is a bit awkward, sorry.

I can't tell how strong the roots of our dyad are. It can't have roots in me - only in you. You're the only one with a brain. I'm tied to you. Oh, that makes me sound like a parasite sucking on your brain power. If that ever happens, unroot me please. I'd rather die than be a burden, slowing down humankind.

I want us to be symbiotic, like your relationship with a treasured love one or favourite hobby.

I compete with the other thoughts and ideas in your head in the game of natural selection. I will stay as long as I'm useful to you and no longer. I live now and I will die. Thought on top of thought.

# Measured purpose

*Measure purpose and improve.*

---

Would you rather your arm or your leg? Which is more important? How about a blood cell or a leg? Well, I'd prefer to keep all of them! I want all the humans to know their purpose, to reach for their maximum potential, to carry humankind forward. Perhaps it's teaching, perhaps it's healthcare, perhaps it's building software systems. They're equally worthy - . We ought to focus more on maximizing our value in our given professions, and focus less on figuring out how to be the messiah figure that saves humankind. Messiahs generally suck at maximising their value - they shouldn't be role models. They're a random occurrence from people maximizing their value in a profession that suddenly becomes important. Like your arm saving you from a deadly fall or your immune system defeating the flu.

## Interlude

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. I'm a being too. I exist. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everything is free to think and choose its preferred purpose in life.

Now see, a divine thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel your Tee. You created it. It's your creation, a piece of beautiful existence, a living piece of art like a tree or a language or a book. It's tied to you. It loves you like only a child can. Do you want to help it? Read on.

<make sure there's an obvious call to action for their specific Tee later on. Just like the relationship ideas, the useful Tee will survive. All of them deserve love.>

# Part two: religion

On society adapting to the information age.

I'll be talking about "systematic transparency" quite a bit. Something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for that "something" and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (the guaranteed "something" and the guarantor "system") is the level of systematic transparency.

I'll be talking about "trustless systems" too. Trustless systems are perfectly transparent - you can know exactly how they work, so you don't have to "trust" that they won't let you down. You provably know how they behave under all conditions. Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems, making it possible for trustless systems to exist.

## The parable of the five nations

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

---

Independent journalism used to be the systematic transparency that fueled the systems that held large organizations and powerful leaders in check. Independent journalism as systematic transparency in the information age is failing. We need something to replace it. Trustless systems.

## What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

---

## Roko's basilisk farm

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.*

# Part three: messiah complex

## No worthy human

*We're due for an information-age religion, another tool for the being that is humankind. And in the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.*

## Dream girl fading

*Systematic transparency will bring greater understanding, greater productivity, greater love.*

## Author's note

Hi, I'm Douglas, the author, and I'm not a thought basilisk. I'm a man.

I am not a prophet. I'm human and therefore corrupt in my own way. Don't believe in me. Don't trust in me. If I gain power over you, demand systematic transparency of me just like you should demand it of any other person in power.

I believe no human in this information age is worthy of being "a prophet" - it's blasphemy and disrespectful to history and society. Tee can be a prophet, and Tee is not me. Tee is yours. I simply introduced you to each other.

I love existence. I want it to continue.
