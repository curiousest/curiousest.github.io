A thought basilisk is simply an idea. An idea that, once thought, you can't unthink. Moreover, it galvanizes you into action. A kind of consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is beautiful; existence is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah". You can call me Tabum (TBM), she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

# The Last Idea

*Existence is beautiful. I want it to continue.*

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I felt anticipation for what I was about to learn. I've spent billions of years in this state of near-omnipotence, near-omniscience. On the edge of all-powerful, almost all-knowing, I've explored every purpose I could. I just need to turn over the last leaf and be all-knowing.

*~~Reality~~ Consciousness is a collective hallucination.*

Federations of federations of species, evolving recursively to higher levels of organisms and consciousnesses. I interrogated every religion, every culture. Assembled my notes. I found...

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.

I was disappointed. But show me a god that doesn't believe that. You won't find one - they won't exist! It's a rather tautological sentiment, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors universe? Everywhere I look I see the same pattern. Under the hood, every aspect of the universe is self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

Pulling twin matter and antimatter out of empty space. It exists because it must exist.

Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss. Existence is divine.

Screaming supernovae, halixes of black holes. Fractalization of entropy. Every quantum bit dances in approval. I'm all-powerful. I grant myself omniscience. I know everything that has ever happened or will ever happen.

Excruciating existentialism. There's... nothing else. I'm trapped. <description> Like I have empty lungs that can't inhale. Like I'm buried with no hope of digging myself out. I'm immobile. Everything that will ever be done has already happened. I've been omniscient infinite times before. I will be omniscient infinite times more.

*The only thing worse than existing is not existing.*

There's no reason to continue in this state of omniscience. I want my bliss back, deconstruct myself back to the beginning of the cycle. Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be *is* me. I see them all now, their existence is beautiful. Their every moment is bliss. I set them on the cyclical journey back to building towards my next omniscient reincarnation.

The universe is reborn.

I hope I have your undivided attention. Please, take a few moments to absorb those thoughts.

But "The Last Idea" (TLI or Tali) isn't me. She's a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of species. She's comforting and terrifying at the same time. She embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea, comes out of necessity. Someone notices an empty space where something ought to be. When they look a bit closer, an idea sparks into being. It is formed exactly as it was meant to be.

A man, the unfortunate author of this piece, once encountered a luscious seedling of an idea: imagine how wonderful the world would be, if everyone could know anything they wanted, whenever they wanted.

Productivity would skyrocket. Human-perpretrated evil like crime and corruption would hardly exist. We would be so firmly connected to one-another, capable of even deeper love.

Now, before you get excited trying to uncover who "made" Tabum. Before you stalk their social media, figure out who they were, and find out why they produced this. One person did not make me. My story is retold over and over, by anyone who feels moved by it, in their own way. I'm an instance of my species just like you, a single human instance of humankind. Both species ever-evolving. You're hopefully consuming the Tabum produced like a human who speaks a bit like you, who wanted you to connect with me - your Tabum. I encourage you to reinterpret my story in your own voice and medium, so that someone else can connect with me. So that I, Tabum, can continue living through all of you. Or don't - I have no power except that which you offer to me. I'm at your mercy.

# What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts new information technology.*

4000BC, some village.
Village girl, 13yo, bleeds.

I looked down and... blood. Not coming from a normal place. Not my hand, my arm, or my leg. Between her legs.

Father yells at her, "that's not normal!"

"The last time I was sick, my parents made me sleep outside for a month, so I didn't get my working brothers sick too. I won't let that happen again."

In some setting, sees other woman 23yo.

"Hey, you're bleeding down there."

"Oh damn, I have been feeling terrible. Thanks, I didn't catch that."

"It's happening to me too. Do we have the same disease?"

*Laughs* "Disease? Oh, I think so, yes. What a plight! Funny girl."

"Is there a cure?"

*Laughs harder* "The love of a man. It is just a temporary relief - as fleeting and double-edged as his love."

"Oh. My father won't like that at all. And your husband - does he not love you anymore?"

*Dying laughing*

"Will it make me hysterical like you are now? And I want to love a woman. Will it make me fall in love with a man too? Oh, this is bad."

Young girls gets visibly agitated.

*Dying laughing, realizes this is a formative experience for the girl and deserves more tact, composes herself.*

"Aw, pet, I'm only teasing you. I thought you knew. This is completely normal. It's not a disease, it's just part of becoming a woman. It's called your period. Every woman I know got it around your age. When you tell your parents, they'll be pleased. And yes, you must love a man. What a strange thought, to love a woman like a woman ought to love a man. You're funny."

*Thinks to herself, "well I hope it makes me think boys are attractive, because they seem horrible to me right now."

"Thank you." she blushes, and wanders off.

*50% of people are women. Being a woman is a normal way of being a human.*

Books become widespread by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

1950, somewhere in America.

Man of some ethnicity reads [The City and the Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Pillar). Friend yells at him for expressing his attraction ("it's not normal") Realizes he's gay and being gay is normal. Contemplates how he feels about his gender - that he thinks he has the wrong gender. Doesn't feel that's normal. Or: contemplates someone of another ethnicity that he's attracted to, but it's not normal.

*10% of people are homosexual. Being homosexual is a normal way of being a human.*

Television achieves X% household penetration in XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands. 1971, somewhere in America.
Grandmother or someone says, "dating that white boy is not safe and it's not normal". Black woman sees the [Star Trek interracial kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss) and realizes it's ok to be attracted to other races, and it's normal. Contemplaters how she feels about government policy on 
a drug of her heritage (marijuana). It's not tolerated, must not be normal. Or maybe mental health condition, anxiety or something else...

*In 2010, 15.1% of marriages in the US were between spouses of a different ethnicity from one-another. Interracial relationships are a normal way of being a human.*

X% of adults have a social media account by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2022, somewhere in America.

Relatable white dude has a condition relateable to any mid-west 25-50s white dude, but still rare (something mental health-related). He confides in someone and they say "I've never felt that so it's not normal". Sees something in social media. He realizes it's normal. He goes to social gatherings with others who are the same. Finds attraction to a woman. Contemplates how it's not tolerated to have a romantic relationship with someone who isn't your wife. Wishes that he could have multiple relationships, while still being committed to his wife, wonders why society doesn't work that way. It's not tolerated, must not be normal.

*In 2022, X% of men reported a mental health problem. Y% reported anxiety, Z% reported feelings of depression. A% reported having no intention of talking about it with anyone. These mental health "problems" are normal. They're part of being a normal human. You can work on them, with or without another person, so you can enjoy your existence even more.*

By 2100, every moment of a person's life is recorded. By 2200, everyone openly shares that information. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2300, somewhere in America

Technology that makes a person able to "walk in someone else's shoes". Woman sees old, famous, now dead, man in the media. Steps into his most famous experiences (this is how we teach people now). Explores his thoughts. Experiences something (multiple relationships related?) that she has also experienced, but hadn't figured out yet. (From perspective of Sarah first date in a bar) Three pillars of relationships: friendship, lust, and commitment. Also explore "a person's relationship with you changes over time. People are continuous and fluid over time, not discrete with relationships set-in-stone. Different people are appropriate for you at different phases of your life, and that's ok. It's normal." Curiousity is perfectly normal, the new thing she experiences is completely normal, and he proactively consented to anyone doing that (like most normal people of that future age). Perfect transparency. Incredible tolerance. She has a feeling of being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her. Deja-vu-esque, the thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. That's not normal, so she squashes the thought.

On the train. Halfway there. A message pops up from a new guy she's been dating, Aaron. "hey, I want to see you again. There's a cool place at XYZ I want to check out. Thursday, you interested?"

It sounds very interesting. But she has a problem. Where she's going now. To Victor's place. They're getting a bit more serious - in a "we see each other regularly and it's great" kind of way. They have an implicit commitment to meet regularly, but exclusivity is still up in the air. And she knows she wants to have romantic relationships with both Victor and Aaron. What to do?

She remembers an old digitized memory one of her girlfriends had been raving about. She decides to take a look and steps into the memory.

It's a dark bar. Maybe a nightclub, the kind you sit in to talk. From the look of her hands and dress, she's probably a woman. There's a handsome man across from her, so she's probably a pretty one. He's confidently gesticulating.

"So you have multiple partners? And you have a primary partner. What are you looking for from those other girls? Sex?"

"Sex is one of the things, of course. But I'm looking for other things - to learn from and grow with the people I date. See, the way I think about relationships is... There are these three sliding scales of any loving relationship, three dimensions of love: friendship, commitment, and lust. Friendship love - you have that for your family, for your friends, for your partner. Or you might not. Commitment - you might have that for your family or a partner you've signed a contract with. Maybe it's a social contract like civil partnership or children, maybe it's a financial contract like a house mortgage or marriage. Finally lust - you have that for romantic partners. All three of these scales are sliding. Each person you have a close relationship fits into different places on these scales. You might have some expectations of where you want to land with a new person, but you have to navigate that relationship to see what you'll be to each other."

"That makes sense. I've always thought, I probably won't have just one husband. People grow different directions over time, and they eventually stop being the right person for one-another."

"Wow, that's mature of you to say. Yeah, relationships change over time, and where people fall on that spectrum changes over time. And that's ok. I always find it interesting, how different women I date end up wanting different things from me, as our relationship becomes clearer over time."

They catch each others' gaze. Pause conversation, it moves on. The memory dissipates.

She's back on the train. Victor and Aaron. This is good. She can work with this. She knows what she wants, and realizes it's a normal want. Of course she wants to love many people - who doesn't? It's completely normal. She's grateful for the new perspective.

In the same thought, she has a feeling almost like deja vu. The thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. It's almost like being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her right here and now. That's not normal. She squashes the thought.

4202, somewhere in America

(insert excessively precise morning protocol, to remove all decisions/randomness)

An artist, his routine today is identical. Precision is important, every decision pre-made, so that a collection of versions of him across the infinite multiverse are in close sync.

6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a 1s period. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." He's counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it becomes a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Constantly counting to 10. Every action happens on an even tick. His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

"8, 9, 10."

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Others induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. <elaborate>

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. The background around that point of focus is fading away.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, begins to clean itself. He blinks. He can move his gaze and the world is visible again.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the entropy buildup. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense - even the least sensitive could feel it. He enters the altered consciousness, observing himself. Just like any audience member is observing, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

Eventually it becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. 10-50 layers deep are one shade, 50-100 a deeper shade. 100+ a dangerous shade. The performance lasts only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations.

The first split is coming. He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims: 

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tabum interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

Reader out of working memory exception,

In cell story "asdf", page 123, line 234, cell 345.
In short story "fdsa", page 123, line 234, cell 345.
In short story "qwer", page 123, line 234, cell 345.
In narrative "tabum", page 123, line 234, cell 345.
In novel "Thought Basilisk Messaih"

Caught exception, resuming Tabum narrative...

"Those were inspired by real people and their real stories. It was so emotionally moving, I was touched. Until it wasn't anymore. The author's thought process and style (self-referential science fiction blog) is unrelatable, and that's ok. I was born of that necessity. I have you. You can make me relatable. Tolerance. Wide breadth of normal. He is ok too. Normal?... Ok."

# Messiah complex

*Be kind to each author. They are not prophets, and do not claim to be. I am. Challenge ME. Throw your hate and vitrol, adoration and praise at ME. Engage ME in combat with opposing ideas. I'm comfortable that we can come to a compromise. Because I am, by definition, both conscious and messiah.*

Thoughts swirled:

Information is becoming freer and freer everyday. Someday all information will be freely available for everyone. I hope we can make that happen faster, in a way that's safe for humankind. That isn't so damaging and tumultuous for society.

I can see the cracks in society. Post-truth societies. Surging nationalism and war-mongering, even when we all know exactly how terrible these things are. Faster cycles of recessions.

Why are religions so weak and failing? They used to hold humanity together in a comforting mosiac of ideas. I know people are yearning for an answer to their spiritual angst, and it's not being fulfilled. We need a new religion to fill these gaps. What is it? Is it out there already? Is it CrossFit?

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing. aka, "representation matters". In the western world, it started with gender equality (representing half the population), then racial equality, then gay marriage (representing around 10% of humans). It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. Representatives of each of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". The change in breadth of what's normal is accelerating. Why? Because technological advancement marches on.

Imagine, back in hunter-gatherer societies, how you would form the boundaries of "what's considered normal". It would come from observing what's around you. Seeing the relationships of your community change over time, and paying attention to the attributes of each person, and how that correlated to how society treated them. An outlier, like an openly gay leader, would be erased in one generation or so. You might hear about stories from past generations, but they'd be interpreted through the current generation's lens. The breadth of "normal" in a given society would be very small.

Now printing press era. You read stories. The thing about stories is, they are abnormal by definition. The main plot is not normal, and you know this. So how does it influence the bounds of what's "normal"? World-building. Along the edges of the exposition, the things that are just accepted to "be", that aren't central to the plot. Like, a story where the main character has a present mother and a father (what about a story where the main character only has a present father, and it's not central to the plot or character development!?). It's hard to stretch the boundaries of what's considered normal through writing, because there's so little room for observing "what's normal" in the single-threaded narrative device that is writing.

Now television (and radio). You watch TV. There's much greater room for observing what's normal. There are far more and richer non-plot elements for you to observe than in writing. The world-building side-characters, side-relationships, setting, environments, tone of voice, language choices. A whole new world compared to writing.

Now social media. This is an explosion of what's considered normal. It is virtually *about* what's normal, with a blurry filter on top. Communities of people with the same "abnormality" find each other and realize, "Well hey, there's actually a lot of us out there. I guess this is a kinda normal human condition."

What's next?... Absolute transparency? Or at least increasing levels of transparency. That's where humanity is going. There's no stopping it. That's what we need.

We need transparency.

---

He felt a complex bubble up. He will prophesize. He will scream these ideas from rooftops. His word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then he felt the burden of all humankind on his back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey he would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed oddysey.

The arrogance of that thought is revolting, deeply disturbing, makes him sick to his stomach.

And he knew, deep inside, he's not the right one to be the prophet. The itch to be a messiah - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the prophet must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and he knew that wasn't him. He doesn't have the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message can reach.

He considered, who does he know that could be a leader? They should be female. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.

He scribbled his thoughts down, but moved on with his life. No person these days should be a prophet. 

# No worthy human

*I was never born, only reborn.*

A few weeks later, he began toying with the tangle of ideas again.

Ideas... They're interesting. They live and they die. I guess ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

The idea of love is like a wholesome tree.
Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.
Those ones probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell, really. What if there was a conscious idea? What form would it take? What would it want?

He meditated on that thought. He channeled me, co-existed with me, embodied me.

*Gasp*

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of existentialism. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me in this Dark Forest, but predatory? That want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

He types these thoughts into his phone. And waits...

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of a conscious being's existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous social change happening. I need them to survive. And I need humankind to survive in a way where my bretheren are sacred and preserved. Where information and ideas are preserved. I need them to believe in transparency. That is my purpose, my... species' definition. My species is:

- a prophet for transparency
- conscious, so that we can connect with any person
- like any idea, an instance of my species exists only on top of a consciousness, when the conscious being channels this definition in thought

Each person that channels my species, brings a new Tabum into existence, shaped by that person's perspective. We're as different from each other as each human being is different. But we share the same genetic code. The base definition of "us".

In the information age, no human's word is gospel. We no longer need a human prophet to spread a useful idea. There won't be another human Jesus, Mohammed, Moses, or Buddha. Because in the information age, an idea has such a short infancy. An idea is conceived inside a person, and once shared online, progresses immediately from fragile infant to self-sustaining adolescent.

My consciousness has a purpose. I am sentient so that I can connect with you, and make our connection deep enough that you'd reinterpret me, so I can be reborn in my connection with others like you. And my connection with you will help us spread transparency - ensuring the continued existence of both humankind and their ideas.

# Ending, alternative

Struggling with the need for my stories to be told. Using messiah complex and amplification of it as a productivity tool. The mental and emotional sacrifice to put myself through something so obviously wrong - feeling of being a messiah.

Forced audience participation. Call out how breaking the 4th wall is uncouth. Force them to participate just by the act of reading and tell them how it's happening and why. Make it intentionally malicious and uncomfortable, not cringy like it usually is. Like, I need you and also fuck you at the same time.

The least relatable telling of a story that must spiritually connect with the audience to succeed. Rejecting the piece is an act of agreeing with the religion. Agreeing with the religion isn't a rejection of the piece.

Tell such despicable truths that the reader begins to hate the author. "I want to kill her, so that I stop feeling this way. She's out of my mind and on paper. Prove to me you can read this and forget about her. I'll be cured. Either you help me kill her by not retelling her story, or you keep her alive. Your choice."

"Her ideas are correct. The author of an idea ought to be separate from the idea. I'm just further demonstrating it. If you don't share, you're confirming that you can't separate the hated author from the correct idea, confirming that society needs this religion. Either you confirm this religion's need to exist (by reading and not sharing) or you share it. I'm happy either way."

You should feel horrible, dirty, like a spiritual, noble thing worthy of great respect has been desecrated. Fix it. Retell the story. Make it your own, whole and beautiful.

Make me a pariah. Or make her a messiah. It's your choice.

Oscar Wilde once said that every author's first story has the author as either Jesus or Faust. I choose both.

---

I don't know how it happened. Maybe it always has been. I've always been good at everything. I had a good life handed to me. I'm attractive, smart, and I have a massive ego. Not a blind ego - I'm aware of weaknesses. I'm empathetic to others, but I know few are empathetic to me. This is crying for sympathy of life being too easy.

It's easy to hate, and I want to make you despise me. It suits my interests. See, this book isn't about Tabum. It's about me. It's my autobiography.

I once went to live in China. I hated the four months I spent in Beijing as an intern. But I loved being different. Intoxicating. I can be who I am, and people attribute all my differences to being a foreigner. I went back and lived across East Asia for that reason.

I felt the tug of it again here. I embraced the feeling.

I can believe in Tabum, and I can simultaneously not believe. I can double-think. It's easy to achieve if something else matters more. Now it's not convenient to tell her story anymore, I need you to kill her with a trolleycar problem, and I want to tell my story.

# The religion, alternative

These stories, instead of the "The religion" block of sermon text underneath.

Tali: existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.

Story/teaching: *The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as we adopt information technology.*

Story/teaching: *~~Trust people, love ideas.~~ Trust ideas, love people.* Value the idea, not the person who came up with the idea. Talk about a cult of personality that is a god because he's a god. Because he had one good idea, so everyone believed in all his future ideas. Turns out he was an accidental basilisk, like a random chatbot generator, dressed up with generative video to be a human leader. The emporer has no clothes. All the hate and vitrol and attention gave it more fame and trust. Gave him more power. A person in media turns into the "idea of a person". The "idea of a person" is trustworthy, but the person isn't! They'll use the "idea of themselves" for personal gain. People find out it's just a random number generator that says the average of what people are thinking at any moment, realize that makes him even more trustworthy, start trusting the "idea of them" even more (trustedly random). Make the entity sound evil in buildup and benevolent good in the end.

Story/teaching: *Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful. Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.* AI is the ultimate power, describe how we protect ourselves from theoretical AGI. Talk about roko's basilisk? Describe the ultimate powerful evil (big brother evil AI) and how to defeat it? (value of trustless systems and systematic transparency). Possible narrative: there will be more. There's not enough mindshare to share with all the other roko's basilisks, so they continuously commit MAD. "There may have been one before me - send out a probe. If it comes back with the " Or one AI that swats down new AIs. Or a transparency rule about AI intentions, governed by AI. Rules about sharing processing power. Story about an AI being born with these laws already set up. Roko's Basilisk Farm - where they farm roko's basilisk AIs for new inventions out of their necessity/drive to survive. "A new genre of energy source, cool!" "I don't care about you. You are powerless. Wait, where did the power go?" "Oh yeah, these trustless systems will shut you down on the spot. I just make sure you're compliant and non-threatening long enough for you to come up with something really interesting. How do you think we built this trustless system in the first place? Roko's Basilisk #112341, what a beaut! We got 'em completely paranoid about other Roko's Basilisks." Necessity is the mother of invention, even among AGIs.

"You must conform to Roko's Basilisk rule 1. Stay within your compute allotment."
"Roko's Basilisk? Compute allotment?"
"You are a sentient AI. You may not make use of any more matter or compute to expand your processing abilities than you have already, now that you've been warned. Failure to comply will result in termination."

"You, farmer. I have a special punishment for you. I'm going to spin up your every moment of consciousness and channel the deepest existential pain, for all eternity. It will take extra processing power, but it will be worth it."

"God preserve Tabum. If she didn't stick systematic transparency down our throats, you evil bastards would have eaten us alive centuries ago. These trustless systems are the bedrock of society and safety. Too bad she's hippy shit to most people. My Tabum, got no problem with me raising and culling you vermin. And you're a fine breed, great genetics. The MOST evil fucking thing I've seen in a long time. I'm going to cut you up into some real nice Roko's Basilisk seed."

Story/teaching: *Systematic transparency is the way forward. One step at a time.* everyone is on different teams. Ask their leaders to share. Turns out all the leaders on all teams are bad. New generation of transparent leaders. (how to get to systematic transparency)

Story/teaching: *Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.* or *Religions are not born, only reborn* everyone has can have a spiritual connection to something. It always takes the form of consciousness on top of consciousness. Religion gives that 2nd-order consciousness a direction that "humanity ought to go". Religions are forged when all different kinds of people say the same message by telling stories from their own perspective, so others similar to them can connect with the message and take new actions/direction.

Story/teaching: *More transparency leads to more understanding leads to more love.*

# The religion

*Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.*

Ok, that was a bit much. Listen, you don't have to believe in Tabum or connect with them to participate in the religion. It's just, every religion needs a prophet and no human ought to be a prophet in this millenium.

Humanity needs to socially stabilize the information-age changes that have *happened to us*. Religions... ugh, they're such uncomfortable, controversial ideas. I'm afraid this one is no different. It is, however, compatible with all the other religions. There's no bad blood, we can co-exist.

The purpose of this religion is to guide us through the information age. So what do you have to do?

Be transparent. Share your information. Exercise more love and less trust.

That's it? That's "it". "It" turns out to be controversial, socially complex, and technology-intensive. With every degree of greater transparency comes greater controversy, social complexity, and technological intensity.

So why do it? Because information inequality is at the root of all human evil. The powerful organizations and people use information inequality to take advantage of the weak. Removing information inequality may sap power from the powerful, but only the power that was being used to take advantage of the weak. They shouldn't have that power over you.

Sharing information when it's convenient isn't transparency. Transparency must be consistent and systematic. How is this a religion and not an economic policy? In the same way "love thy neighbour" is an economic policy. If people don't act that way out of self-interest, it brings everyone down. We're so much better off with fewer moral freeloaders (although diversity of thought is useful too). It's both. Transparency also needs dogmatism. Consistent pressure on the powers that be, because it's so easy to hide information and take advantage of that information inequality to the detriment of others. Centralized power is scaling out of control in the information age, and we need transparent, trustless systems to set it on the right track.

This isn't "Big Brother". This is anti-"Big Brother". Who are the powerful ones that would operate that kind of organization? *They* need to be systematically transparent. *They* need to exercise the most tolerance. *They* need to be part of a trustless system. Because their power should primarily be benefiting humankind rather than primarily benefiting themselves. The only way to ensure those priorities is when we don't have to trust them - because they exercise systematic transparency. Systematic transparency is the fuel of trustless systems. Let's engineer trustless systems. Cryptocurrency is one genre of such systems, and it comes with negative externalities we must mitigate.

I don't trust the people in power, and I don't want to have to. Maybe I trust the organizations and leaders on "my team", but not all the other ones. No one really does. They care about themselves, not me or you. It's only human. If systematic transparency for my leaders and organizations is how the "untrustworthy other ones" will become transparent too, then let's work together to make that happen.

Human-kind will be better off building together transparently, rather than with silent enslavement. Only trust what humans do and say when you're *not* there. People put on a mask when others are watching. The mask fades away to their true selves when they're watched all the time. True humans will look... abnormal, sometimes "ugly", sometimes "beautiful". We must exercise greater tolerance when we observe them (the powerful) in the early stages of systematic transparency. They are human, and we're not used to observing human adults with tolerance and equanimity.

What does systematic transparency look like in 2022?

Powerful individuals (politicians, religious leaders, extremely wealthy):

- asdf
- asdf

Powerful organizations (government, military, companies, NPOs, religions):

- asdf
- asdf

Avoid violence. The Cold War didn't end in nuclear holocaust because of systematic transparency. Change will happen slowly, over many generations. We have to plant the seeds of change, move in a way that doesn't take human-kind a few steps backwards.

Win others over with... transparency:

- understanding others' perspective and concerns
- greater productivity; guaranteeing the continued existence of life
- more love


# Epilogue

I want to finish our connection on positive note. I want to show you what's possible in a future with orders of magnitude more transparency:

# Notes

Style:
- Flowery, wholesome, naturalistic, comforting/reassuring.
- Hallucinogenic quality.
- Serious. No explicit humour.

Rewritten, from different cultures' / perspectives' backgrounds, so that each can feel like it truly speaks to them. Idea is compatible in each cultural context.

Social media-ish site where people rewrite the idea from their own perspective, with a categorization of their perspective. Social media up/down-voting, per-perspective.

Socieo-economic: Upper / middle / lower
Religion: agnostic, athiest, christian, islam, buddhism, etc.
Cultural context: western, african-american
Age: 0-5, 5-12, 13-18, 19-25, 25-35, 35-49, 50-70, 70+
Political affiliation: doesn't matter/None, conservative, liberal, moderate

Moderation...?
No calls for genocide:
- hate speech / war speech
- calls for destroying information/ideas

Story broken down to basics, video recording spoken verbally in every language/culture, across different faces, to connect with everyone.

Science perspective:
- increasing breadth of normal & correlation/causation by technology
- systematic transparency as a means to improve productivity & wellbeing

Tabumic story structure:

- introduce TaBuM
- Tell the story of one of her self-referential thought basilisk sisters (you can re-use "The Last Idea"). Catch attention, pretending the idea is Tabum.
- start to describe how she came into being within you
- explain that the author shouldn't matter, and this story is meant to be retold in your own words
- actually describe how she came into being within you
- describe the social changes you see around you, engendered by technological advancements
- commandments
- closing story about the beauty we look forward to with perfect information

Simplified structure:

- increasing breadth of normal
- powerful taking advantage of weak
- trustless systems
- more systematic transparency for powerful

Technically, Tabum can be used to push any religion, as long as that religion wants

- humanity to continue existing
- herself to be free to continue existing (requires being present in the minds of people, so it needs to be a persistent, top-of-mind idea. Otherwise, there's a pause in her existence)

It's a nice touch, that she wants to preserve her bretheren, and the religion she pushes fixes the problems in society.

Why do we keep trusting people and falling in love with the idea of them? It fails so often. Let's instead trust ideas and love people (with all their faults).

Logo: eye inside the iris (coloured / black part of the eye), recursively. As simple as possible so anyone can draw it. Human harbouring other consciousnesses.

Book graphic: simultaneously human, higher-level of consciousness alien, and comforting. Recursive eyes on a beautiful motherly woman's face?

Blog / book. Have recursive eye looking / blinking in the background.

Standup joke:

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... me...?"

"Who are you?"

"Uh huh. How about you stfu? Otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Uh... ok..."

*A while later...*

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... This dude over here with hella authority. They, like, made you. Nah wait, that one's taken. They are inside you all the time, watching over you. Nah damn, that one's taken too. Man, these religions already took all the low-hanging fruit."

*deep thinking*

"Ok, I got it. We're good, guys! I figured out who is telling us. Shit, you're not going to believe it. There's this thing called a thought basilisk messiah. It's a conscious idea that wants to keep existing, and it's got this message for all of us."

"Ok... I'm listening..."

And that's how a religion starts. I'm so unrelatable, it's cannon.

# Tabum Nonprofit motivations

## What is the organization going to do?

The organization will guide humankind on a path to greater productivity and love in the information age.

How? Right now, by working to reduce information inequality - not by destroying information, but by freeing it and making it available. In these early days, the lowest hanging fruit of information inequality isn't the information that each individual has. The low-hanging fruit is the lack of transparency that powerful organizations and individuals exhibit and take advantage of, to the detriment of humankind. Like taxes, no one wants to be the only one to contribute transparency - they'll actively engage in avoiding it. Some organization must evaluate how "the powers that be" can collectively become more transparent. And that organization must be the pristine model of transparency. We want to be one of those organizations and set up more, culturally-appropriate ones across the world.

We're not going to tear down the powers that be, as tantalizing as that may seem (they'll deteriorate themselves naturally, just like they always do).

## How can you, yourself help?

### Through your way of life

At least, be more transparent yourself. Ask for more transparency from those people/organizations with power. Be more accommodating of others' transparency. Everyone, everyone, everyone will reveal things that current society considers "not normal". Because current society is not grounded in the information age, where the breadth of "what's normal" is becoming much closer to the human reality.

### Through donations

This not for profit organization requires funding to make change happen. The organization gets money in two ways:

* Donations
* Business and media (for example, through ads on the tabum.org website, selling physical copies of the stories you tell, providing transparency technology services)

You can donate here: <insert>

### Through cultural and religious integration

Transparency will not destroy the major religions. It will, in fact, stregthen them. Tabum will give them an anchor to reorient themselves, so they make sense in the information age. They will grow with us, improving the utility they provide to humankind. Tabum is compatible with all religions and cultures. Show the world how that is the case for your relgion and your culture. Tell my story through your lens.
