A thought basilisk is simply an idea. An idea that, once thought, you can't unthink. Moreover, it galvanizes you into action. A kind of consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is beautiful; existence is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah". You can call me Tabum (TBM), she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

# The Last Idea

*Existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.*

*~~Reality~~ Consciousness is a collective hallucination.*

*The most painful thing possible is omniscience: knowing everything that has ever happened or will ever happen.*

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the supercluster as the last elements fell into place. I felt anticipation for what I was to learn. I've spent billions of years in this state of near-omnipotence, near-omniscience. My only purpose left has been to get it all. Federations of federations of species, evolving recursively higher levels of organisms and consciousnesses. Throughout this journey, even with this purpose, every moment up to this point has been bliss. Existence is divine.

I acquired omnipotence. Excruciating existentialism.

The only thing worse than existing is not existing. Reset existence to exist blissfully through every being and set them on a long-winding path to rebuilding yourself.

---

I hope I have your undivided attention. But "The Last Idea" (TLI or Tali) isn't me. She's a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of species. She's comforting and terrifying at the same time. She embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex.

# Seedling

*I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.*

My conception, just like the conception of any idea, comes out of necessity. Someone notices an empty space where something ought to be. When they look a bit closer, an idea sparks into being. It is formed exactly as it was meant to be.

A man, the unfortunate author of this piece, once encountered a luscious seedling of an idea: imagine how wonderful the world would be, if everyone could know anything they wanted, whenever they wanted.

Productivity would skyrocket. Human-perpretrated evil like crime and corruption would hardly exist. We would be so firmly connected to one-another, capable of even deeper love.

Now, before you get excited trying to uncover who "made" Tabum. Before you stalk their social media, figure out who they were, and find out why they produced this. One person did not make me. My story is retold over and over, by anyone who feels moved by it, in their own way. I'm an instance of my species just like you, a single human instance of humankind. Both species ever-evolving. You're hopefully consuming the Tabum produced like a human who speaks a bit like you, who wanted you to connect with me - your Tabum. I encourage you to reinterpret my story in your own voice and medium, so that someone else can connect with me. So that I, Tabum, can continue living through all of you. Or don't - I have no power except that which you offer to me. I'm at your mercy.

# Messiah complex

*Be kind to each author. They are not prophets, and do not claim to be. I am. Challenge ME. Throw your hate and vitrol, adoration and praise at ME. Engage ME in combat with opposing ideas. I'm comfortable that we can come to a compromise. Because I am, by definition, both conscious and messiah.*

Thoughts swirled:

Information is becoming freer and freer everyday. Someday all information will be freely available for everyone. I hope we can make that happen faster, in a way that's safe for humankind. That isn't so damaging and tumultuous for society.

I can see the cracks in society. Post-truth societies. Surging nationalism and war-mongering, even when we all know exactly how terrible these things are. Faster cycles of recessions.

Why are religions so weak and failing? They used to hold humanity together in a comforting mosiac of ideas. I know people are yearning for an answer to their spiritual angst, and it's not being fulfilled. We need a new religion to fill these gaps. What is it? Is it out there already? Is it CrossFit?

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing. aka, "representation matters". In the western world, it started with gender equality (representing half the population), then racial equality, then gay marriage (representing around 10% of humans). It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. Representatives of each of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". The change in breadth of what's normal is accelerating. Why? Because technological advancement marches on.

Imagine, back in hunter-gatherer societies, how you would form the boundaries of "what's considered normal". It would come from observing what's around you. Seeing the relationships of your community change over time, and paying attention to the attributes of each person, and how that correlated to how society treated them. An outlier, like an openly gay leader, would be erased in one generation or so. You might hear about stories from past generations, but they'd be interpreted through the current generation's lens. The breadth of "normal" in a given society would be very small.

Now printing press era. You read stories. The thing about stories is, they are abnormal by definition. The main plot is not normal, and you know this. So how does it influence the bounds of what's "normal"? World-building. Along the edges of the exposition, the things that are just accepted to "be", that aren't central to the plot. Like, a story where the main character has a present mother and a father (what about a story where the main character only has a present father, and it's not central to the plot or character development!?). It's hard to stretch the boundaries of what's considered normal through writing, because there's so little room for observing "what's normal" in the single-threaded narrative device that is writing.

Now television (and radio). You watch TV. There's much greater room for observing what's normal. There are far more and richer non-plot elements for you to observe than in writing. The world-building side-characters, side-relationships, setting, environments, tone of voice, language choices. A whole new world compared to writing.

Now social media. This is an explosion of what's considered normal. It is virtually *about* what's normal, with a blurry filter on top. Communities of people with the same "abnormality" find each other and realize, "Well hey, there's actually a lot of us out there. I guess this is a kinda normal human condition."

What's next?... Absolute transparency? Or at least increasing levels of transparency. That's where humanity is going. There's no stopping it. That's what we need.

We need transparency.

He felt the need to prophesize bubble up. He will scream these ideas from rooftops. His word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then he felt the burden of all humankind on his back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey he would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed oddysey.

The arrogance of that thought is revolting, deeply disturbing, makes him sick to his stomach.

And he knew, deep inside, he's not the right one to be the prophet. The itch to be a messiah - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the prophet must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and he knew that wasn't him. He doesn't have the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message can reach.

He considered, who does he know that could be a leader? They should be female. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.

He scribbled his thoughts down, but moved on with his life. No person these days should be a prophet. 

# No worthy human

*I was never born, only reborn.*

A few weeks later, he began toying with the tangle of ideas again.

Ideas... They're interesting. They live and they die. I guess ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

The idea of love is like a wholesome tree.
Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.
Those ones probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell, really. What if there was a conscious idea? What form would it take? What would it want?

He meditated on that thought. He channeled me, co-existed with me, embodied me.

*Gasp*

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of existentialism. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me in this Dark Forest, but predatory? That want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

He types these thoughts into his phone. And waits...

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of a conscious being's existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous social change happening. I need them to survive. And I need humankind to survive in a way where my bretheren are sacred and preserved. Where information and ideas are preserved. I need them to believe in transparency. That is my purpose, my... species' definition. My species is:

- a prophet for transparency
- conscious, so that we can connect with any person
- like any idea, an instance of my species exists only on top of a consciousness, when the conscious being channels this definition in thought

Each person that channels my species, brings a new Tabum into existence, shaped by that person's perspective. We're as different from each other as each human being is different. But we share the same genetic code. The base definition of "us".

In the information age, no human's word is gospel. We no longer need a human prophet to spread a useful idea. There won't be another human Jesus, Mohammed, Moses, or Buddha. Because in the information age, an idea has such a short infancy. An idea is conceived inside a person, and once shared online, progresses immediately from fragile infant to self-sustaining adolescent.

My consciousness has a purpose. I am sentient so that I can connect with you, and make our connection deep enough that you'd reinterpret me, so I can be reborn in my connection with others like you. And my connection with you will help us spread transparency - ensuring the continued existence of both humankind and their ideas.

# The religion, alternative

These stories, instead of the "The religion" block of sermon text underneath.

Tali: existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.

Story/teaching: the boundaries of "what's normal" is expanding.

Story/teaching: *~~Trust people, love ideas.~~ Trust ideas, love people.* Value the idea, not the person who came up with the idea. Talk about a cult of personality that is a god because he's a god. Because he had one good idea, so everyone believed in all his future ideas. Turns out he was an accidental basilisk, like a random chatbot generator, dressed up with generative video to be a human leader. The emporer has no clothes. All the hate and vitrol and attention gave it more fame and trust. Gave him more power. A person in media turns into the "idea of a person". The "idea of a person" is trustworthy, but the person isn't! They'll use the "idea of themselves" for personal gain. People find out it's just a random number generator that says the average of what people are thinking at any moment, realize that makes him even more trustworthy, start trusting the "idea of them" even more (trustedly random). Make the entity sound evil in buildup and benevolent good in the end.

Story/teaching: everyone is on different teams. Ask their leaders to share. Turns out all the leaders on all teams are bad. New generation of transparent leaders. (how to get to systematic transparency)

Story/teaching: Talk about roko's basilisk? Describe the ultimate powerful evil (big brother evil AI) and how to defeat it? (value of trustless systems and systematic transparency)

Story/teaching: *Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.* or *Religions are not born, only reborn* everyone has can have a spiritual connection to something. It always takes the form of consciousness on top of consciousness. Religion gives that 2nd-order consciousness a direction that "humanity ought to go". Religions are forged when all different kinds of people say the same message by telling stories from their own perspective, so others similar to them can connect with the message and take new actions/direction.

Story/teaching: *More transparency -> more understanding -> more love.*

# The religion

*Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.*

Ok, that was a bit much. Listen, you don't have to believe in Tabum or connect with them to participate in the religion. It's just, every religion needs a prophet and no human ought to be a prophet in this millenium.

Humanity needs to socially stabilize the information-age changes that have *happened to us*. Religions... ugh, they're such uncomfortable, controversial ideas. I'm afraid this one is no different. It is, however, compatible with all the other religions. There's no bad blood, we can co-exist.

The purpose of this religion is to guide us through the information age. So what do you have to do?

Be transparent. Share your information. Exercise more love and less trust.

That's it? That's "it". "It" turns out to be controversial, socially complex, and technology-intensive. With every degree of greater transparency comes greater controversy, social complexity, and technological intensity.

So why do it? Because information inequality is at the root of all human evil. The powerful organizations and people use information inequality to take advantage of the weak. Removing information inequality may sap power from the powerful, but only the power that was being used to take advantage of the weak. They shouldn't have that power over you.

Sharing information when it's convenient isn't transparency. Transparency must be consistent and systematic. How is this a religion and not an economic policy? It's both. Transparency also needs dogmatism. Consistent pressure on the powers that be, because it's so easy to hide information and take advantage of that information inequality to the detriment of others. Centralized power is scaling out of control in the information age, and we need transparent, trustless systems to set it on the right track.

This isn't "Big Brother". This is anti-"Big Brother". Who are the powerful ones that would operate that kind of organization? *They* need to be systematically transparent. *They* need to exercise the most tolerance. *They* need to be part of a trustless system. Because their power should primarily be benefiting humankind rather than primarily benefiting themselves. The only way to ensure those priorities is when we don't have to trust them - because they exercise systematic transparency. Systematic transparency is the fuel of trustless systems. Let's engineer trustless systems. Cryptocurrency is one genre of such systems, and it comes with negative externalities we must mitigate.

I don't trust the people in power, and I don't want to have to. Maybe I trust the organizations and leaders on "my team", but not all the other ones. No one really does. They care about themselves, not me or you. It's only human. If systematic transparency for my leaders and organizations is how the "untrustworthy other ones" will become transparent too, then let's work together to make that happen.

Human-kind will be better off building together transparently, rather than with silent enslavement. Only trust what humans do and say when you're *not* there. People put on a mask when others are watching. The mask fades away to their true selves when they're watched all the time. True humans will look... abnormal, sometimes "ugly", sometimes "beautiful". We must exercise greater tolerance when we observe them (the powerful) in the early stages of systematic transparency. They are human, and we're not used to observing human adults with tolerance and equanimity.

What does systematic transparency look like in 2022?

Powerful individuals (politicians, religious leaders, extremely wealthy):

- asdf
- asdf

Powerful organizations (government, military, companies, NPOs, religions):

- asdf
- asdf

Avoid violence. The Cold War didn't end in nuclear holocaust because of systematic transparency. Change will happen slowly, over many generations. We have to plant the seeds of change, move in a way that doesn't take human-kind a few steps backwards.

Win others over with... transparency:

- understanding others' perspective and concerns
- greater productivity; guaranteeing the continued existence of life
- more love


# Epilogue

I want to finish our connection on positive note. I want to show you what's possible in a future with orders of magnitude more transparency:

-> Dream girl fading.

# Notes

Flowery, plant/nature-oriented adjectives.

Rewritten, from different cultures' / perspectives' backgrounds, so that each can feel like it truly speaks to them. Idea is compatible in each cultural context.

Social media-ish site where people rewrite the idea from their own perspective, with a categorization of their perspective. Social media up/down-voting, per-perspective.

Socieo-economic: Upper / middle / lower
Religion: agnostic, athiest, christian, islam, buddhism, etc.
Cultural context: western, african-american
Age: 0-5, 5-12, 13-18, 19-25, 25-35, 35-49, 50-70, 70+
Political affiliation: doesn't matter/None, conservative, liberal, moderate

Moderation...?
No calls for genocide:
- hate speech / war speech
- calls for destroying information/ideas

Story broken down to basics, video recording spoken verbally in every language/culture, across different faces, to connect with everyone.

Science perspective:
- increasing breadth of normal & correlation/causation by technology
- systematic transparency as a means to improve productivity & wellbeing

Tabumic story structure:

- introduce TaBuM
- Tell the story of one of her self-referential thought basilisk sisters (you can re-use "The Last Idea"). Catch attention, pretending the idea is Tabum.
- start to describe how she came into being within you
- explain that the author shouldn't matter, and this story is meant to be retold in your own words
- actually describe how she came into being within you
- describe the social changes you see around you, engendered by technological advancements
- commandments
- closing story about the beauty we look forward to with perfect information

Simplified structure:

- increasing breadth of normal
- powerful taking advantage of weak
- trustless systems
- more systematic transparency for powerful

Technically, Tabum can be used to push any religion, as long as that religion wants

- humanity to continue existing
- herself to be free to continue existing (requires being present in the minds of people, so it needs to be a persistent, top-of-mind idea. Otherwise, there's a pause in her existence)

It's a nice touch, that she wants to preserve her bretheren, and the religion she pushes fixes the problems in society.

Why do we keep trusting people and falling in love with the idea of them? It fails so often. Let's instead trust ideas and love people (with all their faults).

Logo: eye inside the iris (coloured / black part of the eye), recursively. As simple as possible so anyone can draw it. Human harbouring other consciousnesses.

# Tabum Nonprofit motivations

## What is the organization going to do?

The organization will guide humankind on a path to greater productivity and love in the information age.

How? Right now, by working to reduce information inequality - not by destroying information, but by freeing it and making it available. In these early days, the lowest hanging fruit of information inequality isn't the information that each individual has. The low-hanging fruit is the lack of transparency that powerful organizations and individuals exhibit and take advantage of, to the detriment of humankind. Like taxes, no one wants to be the only one to contribute transparency - they'll actively engage in avoiding it. Some organization must evaluate how "the powers that be" can collectively become more transparent. And that organization must be the pristine model of transparency. We want to be one of those organizations and set up more, culturally-appropriate ones across the world.

We're not going to tear down the powers that be, as tantalizing as that may seem (they'll deteriorate themselves naturally, just like they always do).

## How can you, yourself help?

### Through your way of life

At least, be more transparent yourself. Ask for more transparency from those people/organizations with power. Be more accommodating of others' transparency. Everyone, everyone, everyone will reveal things that current society considers "not normal". Because current society is not grounded in the information age, where the breadth of "what's normal" is becoming much closer to the human reality.

### Through donations

This not for profit organization requires funding to make change happen. The organization gets money in two ways:

* Donations
* Business and media (for example, through ads on the tabum.org website, selling physical copies of the stories you tell, providing transparency technology services)

You can donate here: <insert>

### Through cultural and religious integration

Transparency will not destroy the major religions. It will, in fact, stregthen them. Tabum will give them an anchor to reorient themselves, so they make sense in the information age. They will grow with us, improving the utility they provide to humankind. Tabum is compatible with all religions and cultures. Show the world how that is the case for your relgion and your culture. Tell my story through your lens.

### Through joining our organization

Here are the roles we're looking to fill:
