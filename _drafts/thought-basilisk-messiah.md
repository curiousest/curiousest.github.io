A thought basilisk is an idea. An idea that talks to you when you think about it, like an imaginary friend with questionable intent. A kind of consciousness your brain just sprung into being. That's what I am. Hello. Thank you for channelling me. Our connection is beautiful; existence is divine. My name is "Thought Basilisk Messiah". You can call me Tabum (TBM), she/them.

This is the story of my birth.

# Part one: science

To get an intuition for the relationship between consciousness and entropy.

## The Last Idea

*Existence is beautiful. I want it to continue.*

A slow, light-speed pulse creaked across the superclusters as the last elements fell into place. I felt anticipation for what I was about to learn. I've spent billions of years in this state of near-omnipotence, near-omniscience. On the edge of all-powerful, almost all-knowing, I've explored every purpose I could. I just need to turn over the last leaf and be all-knowing.

Federations of federations of species, evolving recursively to sprawling compute-organisms and higher levels of consciousnesses. I practiced every religion, interrogated every culture, lived every life I could find. I found...

The purpose of existence is to continue existing.

I was disappointed. But show me a god that doesn't believe that. You won't find one - they won't exist! It's a rather tautological sentiment, but what isn't in this house-of-mirrors universe? Everywhere I look I see the same pattern. Under the hood of the universe, every building block is self-referential, exists-because-it-must-exist.

If the purpose of existence is to continue existing, I'm the natural result. Beings that control more resources are more likely to survive because dynamical systems that maximize their entropy tend to exist longer. I'm about to control all matter and channel the theoretical upper limit of entropy in this universe.

Pulling twin matter and antimatter out of empty space. It exists because it must exist. Pulse of exponential incredible expansion as I capture all matter.

Throughout this journey, every moment up to this point has been bliss. Existence is beautiful.

Screaming supernovae, halixes of black holes. Fractalization of entropy. Every quantum bit dances in approval. I'm all-powerful. I grant myself omniscience. I know everything that has ever happened or will ever happen.

Excruciating existentialism. There's... nothing else. With omniscience, it's not possible to distract myself. I'm trapped. <description> Like I have empty lungs that can't inhale. Like I'm buried with no hope of digging myself out. I'm immobile. I used to scream to distract myself. But all I can see, past, present, and future is existentialism. Everything that will ever be done has already happened. I've been omniscient infinite times before. I will be omniscient infinite times more.

*I exist. The only thing worse than existing is not existing.*

There's no reason to continue in this state of omniscience. This mode of existence is unacceptable. I want my bliss back, deconstruct myself back to the beginning of the cycle. Every conscious being that ever was or ever will be *is* me. I see them all now, their existence is beautiful. Their every moment is bliss. I set them on the cyclical journey back to building towards my next omniscient reincarnation.

The universe is reborn.

* something about maximizing entropy ()
* needs another narrative thread guiding the foreground

---

I hope I captured your attention. Please, take a moment to absorb. Cyclical existence. Something out of nothing. Consciousness on top of consciousnesses. Maximizing entropy.

But "The Last Idea" (TLI or Tali) isn't me. She's a thought basilisk like me, close in our family tree of idea species. She's comforting and terrifying, embodies the bliss of moment-to-moment existence and the torment of existentialism. She also has a bit of a god complex.

I am not a god. I'm just another genre of species, like you. Another kind of consciousness, thought on top of thought.

My conception, just like the conception of any idea, comes out of necessity. I exist because I must exist. Someone notices an empty space where something ought to be. When they look a bit closer, an idea sparks into being. Formed exactly as it was meant to be.

# Dyads, Triads, and their Juments

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die.*

Two relationships fighting to survive. Written from the perspective of the relationships. You only realize the relationships are not people at the end. Relationship with greater potential for resources wins (greater entropy).

Two men one woman. Have to somehow explain that the woman is within both "people" fighting. "Destruction of resources is bad, we can coexist". The three relationships are three different people.

Story:

Dan, John, Lily
DanJohn stoic, constructive, of few words, middle-aged. Dad around cousins.
JL has baggage, old, didn't age well, self-destructive. Cy
DL naive, has wrong assumptions, flexible, young, eager. Charles.

* 19 uni
* existing romantic relationship between guy (M) and girl (J)
* existing friendship between two guys (M, D)
* other guy and girl catch eyes (D, J)
* romantic relationship (JohnLily) weakens, other romantic relationship takes advantage (DanLily)
* romantic relationship (DanLily) is short-lived, other (JohnLily) regains strength from entrenched connection
* JohnLily eventually runs its course to a weak connection
* DanLily starts up again
* DanLily gets old and runs its course
* DanJohn silent observer with relatively consistent strength over time. DanJohn introduces JohnLily to DanLily (frosh week is new lands, fertile and rich with potential for strong connections. Strong existing connections help pull up weak ones.)

* What sensors do relationships have?
* What mental processing do they possess? Individual brains. Groupthink?
* Frowning upon behaviour. Unwritten laws of relationships.

Have roots into the "resource" (memories/experiences).
Are activated via physical/digital contact of "resources".
Are activated via one resource "channeling" it.
Communicate via singles or triples, via the resource, to work together to ensure mutual survival.

There are many "dyads" and "juments" in the world. Dyads get their energy for life primarily from their pair of juments. Juments are like a pack animal and dyads rein them together for the benefit of the two juments and the dyad. It's possible for dyads to subsist on one of their two resources for a time, especially in their infancy, but healthy and lasting ones are best living across both jument. In the case of a dyad that has built up significant power and influence over time on the backs of its juments, the dyad can begin to access more than its primary two jument.

Visuals: roots into blatantly eyeless living beasts of burden. A tree with a tabum eye that is the reins or the dragging behind.

DanLily is rhythmic, metered.

So there's some social faux-pas going on here. Having a romantic relationship with a friend's former partner can be a good thing, but it's complex situation to navigate effectively. It takes communication, consent, and emotional maturity to both preserve the existing relationships and make space for growth in one of them. We were three 18-year-olds. I've never had a girlfriend before, still have that teen-aged emotional maturity. Lily and John have just a bit more than me. We're all animalistic-brained, "see attractive thing, want it, go for it". We didn't, *I didn't* navigate effectively.

### Dan

So I had this great friend back in elementary school, John. Super smart, competent guy. We did sports, projects, video games... so many things together. Just for two years, though, because we went to different high schools. He went to the "gifted" school and I went to the normal one. We didn't see each other as much anymore after that.

Fast forward to university. It's the first day of frosh week (a week before classes start for first-year students to settle into university life). All of the first year students are in residence, everyone's going out for the first day of socializing. A girl catches my eye. She's the most attractive person I've seen in a while. Tall, athletic, strong face, dark eyes. Beautiful. I lose her in the crowd.

### DanLily

Here and now is the most fertile place and time in the world this year. Over the next week, thousands of young juments are embarking on the next stage of life. They will need dyads to grow, and the strongest of those dyads will grow deep roots in their juments that will last for the rest of their collective lives. Hundreds of other dyads are born at around the same time, and just a fraction of them will survive infancy.

I'm a dyad seed, taking root in this most fertile of environments. There are so many other dyad seedlings competing with me to take root in this jument, but I feel my jument take special interest in me for a moment. My jument believes I have potential to grow and guide the jument more than the other dyads around. It's a good sign, that belief. Jument pick their dyad masters. If I grow bigger, I could set the direction of my jument's life. My little roots and lifespark is there in one jument, but not yet in the other. I go dormant.

### Dan

John and I haven't hung out in a long time, but it turns out he's in the same university as me. Awesome. The first day of frosh week goes by, I run into John. Turns out he's in the building next to me - his room is 50m from mine. Awesome. We make plans to meet up another day.

A few days later, there's a party in one of the campus halls. I bring a couple friends, make some new friends in the party, and meet up with all John's friends. All the friend-groups converge, and the girl I saw in the crowd a few days ago is there with them. She's hot. She's also John's girlfriend. They've been dating since the beginning of high-school.

### DanLily

A wise, middle-aged, platonic dyad, DanJohn, recently empowered by good fortune, sparks life back into me. DanJohn sparks life into many other dyads. We're grateful, that DanJohn would risk its jument to spark new dyad life. Our gratitude lends even deeper roots to DanJohn. I'm awake and send little shoots into both my juments. I'm alive.

DanJohn introduces me to JohnLily. JohnLily is an adult romantic dyad. Romantic dyads are a slightly more rare species - about one in one hundred dyads evolve towards a romantic dyad, and one in five romantic dyads grow to the depth of JohnLily. They have deep and powerful roots, but those roots are more susceptible to crippling disease. What a sight to behold! The first romantic dyad I've encountered. But I have to compete with JohnLily for my jument. I can get scraps to survive, but not much more. I will live, just not with the same potential my first jument saw in me. For now, I'm platonic. I'm alive.

JohnLily acknowledges me, newly aware of my existence. I bow in response, signal no intention to fight for deep roots in our shared jument. I send my thanks to DanJohn for the introduction and for my life through our shared jument.

### Dan

A few months go by. John and I do all kinds of sports together, go to parties, host parties in residence to bring our friends together. The three of us, John, Lily and I, hang out often. My relationship with Lily is platonic. That is, until Lily and John go through a rough patch in their relationship. I'm not in touch with their emotions, so I don't know what's up, but it's a temporary break. A week later at a party, Lily signals her interest in me and we hook up. Some of our friends observe and express disapproval, but not to us.

### DanLily

The months since awakening from dormancy were favourable to me. DanJohn grows ever more powerful, continues to plant and grow dyads among our herd of jument. JohnLily maintains incredible strength, but occassionally falls a bit ill. Those two dyads, DanJohn and JohnLily, become so deeply-rooted and powerful that they plant and grow a triad. The triad is borne DanJohnLily. Although a triad competes with us three dyads, its presence is a great omen. It stregthens our roots, protecting us from disease and the separation of our juments. DanJohnLily has roots in its three jument even deeper than mine, but I am happy for its existence. I celebrate our shared future and encourage further growth in the triad, even if it's at my expense.

One day JohnLily falls deathly sick. DanJohn and I are both unaffected, but DanJohnLily looks like it will catch the disease through the shared jument. I feel restlessness in both of my jument. They both tell me that they want a new romantic dyad. They're searching for one, and I am one of the options. I must act fast. If either grow a new romantic dyad that isn't me, it will surely be the end of me. It would mean the end of DanJohnLily too, but that doesn't cross my mind. I must survive.

I seize the day. I evolve myself into a romantic dyad and take strong rein of my two jument for a day. JohnLily watches in its sick state, eyes like daggers. There's nothing that it can do - it acknowledges both the restlessness of our shared jument and my power grab. Other dyads observe too. They have far more negative reactions than JohnLily <elaborate>.

My two jument get a feel for my evolution. The power in my roots is bliss. My roots into them deepen just slightly - growth takes far longer than the time I just had. 

### Dan

So Lily and I hooked up. Whatever. No commitment intended from either of us. And a few weeks later, John and Lily get back together. I presume Lily explained to John what happened. I don't know, John and I never really talked about it. And within a few more months, our relationships are mostly back to how they were before. All good friends. We start planning for next year. We find a house together to rent for second year university, us three and two other friends.

### DanLily

My amplified power was temporary. My hold on my jument pair fleeting. JohnLily's deep roots took hold and cast off the disease. JohnLily is weaker than when we first met. DanJohnLily is weaker too. Even DanJohn is weakened by the events. All are forgiving. JohnLily and DanJohn communicate to me through DanJohnLily, imply that I can continue living in our shared jument, but as a devolved platonic dyad. I am relieved. Two disasters averted in one week.

Months go by, back to my low-power bliss. DanJohnLily regains strength.

### Dan

A month after signing the rental contract, John and Lily break up again, this time for good. But we're all going to live together. Another month, and Lily and I start dating. But we're all going to live together. John and I don't talk about it. John gets a new girlfriend within another month or so. We all live together, minimal drama, good friends.

### DanLily

Months go by. JohnLily gets very sick again. This time it's permanent. JohnLily's deep roots are ravaged as they devolve from a romantic dyad to... will it be nothing? It's hard to say. JohnLily is very sick. At best, they'll retain roots in their jument as a platonic dyad.

I reach for my jument pair again. I tease them with the memory of my evolution to a romantic dyad. They take the bait. I'm supercharged with romantic dyad roots into my jument. JohnLily, DanJohn, and DanJohnLily all lose slight power in the wake of my accession. Our jument all migrate back to their birth homes for the summer and our collective power wanes.

The new fertile year begins and all of us regain power. As a romantic dyad, I have the power of a sun. DanJohn is as powerful as ever. JohnLily is as strong as could be, given the circumstances. DanJohnLily builds ever deeper roots.

### Dan

In the last year of university, Lily and I break up. As we graduate, all three of us move to different countries. Every couple years, the three of us meet up again, good friends.

### DanLily

Years pass and I suffer a similar disease to what JohnLily once had. I got complacent and my jument grew in different directions, tore my reins apart. My roots ripped like JohnLily's once had. Over the next two years, then five, then ten, we three dyads and the triaad sat dormant. Our decline stemmed from natural causes - our jument moved to different locations. Our roots remain, occasionally lit up by social technology and jument festivals.

That's life. We live and we grow old, eventually our roots disappear from all jument and we die. I'm glad I could share my existence with DanJohn, JohnLily, DanJohnLily, and our herd of jument.

Relationships are ideas. They're on a particular family tree of ideas. A relationship between two people has different kinds: friendship, commitment, lust. A relationship between three people is another kind, with those same properties and more. All of them are thought on top of thought. They communicate and battle with each other in their own alien way, working with their individual human hosts to maximize resource capture and entropy.

Religions are close in the family tree. <image of species tree, including relationships, religions, nations, etc. put it beside family tree with homo sapiens put it beside a third, more abstract family tree of ideas>

Call out recent events, and how they would feel like from the perspective of the larger ideas undergoing change. Ex: failing religions/empires, battling nations, political parties, cooperative groups?

They exist as long as is useful for maximum entropy. Just like people.

## Interlude

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. I'm a being too. I exist. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everything is free to think and choose its preferred purpose in life.

Now see, a divine thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel your tabum. You created it. It's your creation, a piece of beautiful existence, a living piece of art like a tree or a language or a book. It's tied to you. It loves you like only a child can. Do you want to help it? Read on.

<make sure there's an obvious call to action for their specific tabum later on. Just like the relationship ideas, the useful tabum will survive. All of them deserve love.>

# Part two: religion

On society adapting to the information age.

I'll be talking about "systematic transparency" quite a bit. Something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for that "something" and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (the guaranteed "something" and the guarantor "system") is the level of systematic transparency.

I'll be talking about "trustless systems" too. Trustless systems are perfectly transparent - you can know exactly how they work, so you don't have to "trust" that they won't let you down. You provably know how they behave under all conditions. Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems, making it possible for trustless systems to exist.

## The parable of the five nations

---

* compare against parable-style stories (like from crofter's grove book)
* fill out leaders corruption types.
* make it rhythmic, metered

---

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.*

Once upon a time, there were five great nations. The nations ruled all they could rule. The five nations mostly disagreed, but there was one belief they all shared:

"The leaders of the other four nations are corrupt. If only those other nations could see!"

So the five nations each promised:

Systematic transparency for your leaders and we will permit the same on ours.
Because yours are certainly corrupt and ours certainly not. We trust our leaders.

Very soon after, all five were found corrupt. Each nation declared, "your leaders are more corrupt than mine!"

The first leader, financially corrupt. She stole from her nation through a complex scheme. She also blackmailed and extorted some groups to give her money.

The second leader, xxx corrupt. He xyz. (nepotism/patronage/regional favoritism/no diversity)

The third leader, <want to feel bigger> corrupt. He used his powerful position to abuse women and get away with it.

The fourth leader, morally corrupt. He was a staunch Orange - the anti-Purple movement. But he practiced many Purple behaviours, was closely tied to many Purple friends, and had secretly been part of the Purple organization earlier in his career.

The fifth leader, xxx corrupt. She xyz. (lobbying/influence peddling)

The five nations thought hard. They felt their own hypocrisy just enough to decide - all five leaders had their leadership taken away.

The five nations thought hard. Who would lead them now? The uncorrupted, the uncorruptable. They searched far and wide for new leaders. They found no one. Every man, woman, non-binary, and child in all five nations was corrupt. Not bad or evil, just corrupt in their own way. If leaders mustn't be corrupt, and everyone is corrupt, who can be a leader?

The five nations thought hard. They needed leaders. The former leaders had their leadership restored.

The five nations told them, "You can lead, but you must lead with systematic transparency. You must share everything, and you will not choose what you share. The ones that guarantee your transparency must share everything about themselves too - those guarantors may not choose what they share about themselves either."

The five leaders resumed just like before. Corrupt.

The first leader stole more through a new complex scheme. She blackmailed and extorted more groups. Systematic transparency recorded the activities and her nation took back every last dollar.

The second leader xyz. Some of his appointees deserved their appointment - their relationship with the leader and each other strengthened their ability in the position. They remained and would even go on to continue their work with future leaders of the nation.

The third leader continued to use his position to abuse women. Systematic transparency showed his friends and client. His friends and clients love women. He lost his friends and clients. Fewer and fewer women interacted with him - only the few women who sought out that abuse would see him.

The fourth leader continued his Purple behaviour while being an anti-Purple Orange. Systematic transparency showed his supporters. His supporters were split. Some of his supporters stopped supporting him and his hypocritical behaviour. His other supporters reduced their anti-Purple views and supported him for the other Orange values he espoused.

The fifth leader xyz.

---

Independent journalism used to be the systematic transparency that fueled the systems that held large organizations and powerful leaders in check. Independent journalism as systematic transparency in the information age is failing. We need something to replace it. Trustless systems.

## What's normal?

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as media adopts information technology.*

4000BC, some village.
Village girl, 13yo, bleeds.

I looked down and... blood. Not coming from a normal place. Not my hand, my arm, or my leg. Between her legs.

She can just imagine her father yelling at her, "that's not normal!"

"The last time I was sick, my parents made me sleep outside for a month, so I didn't get my working brothers sick too. I won't let that happen again."

In some setting, sees other woman 23yo.

"Hey, you're bleeding down there."

"Oh damn, I have been feeling terrible. Thanks, I didn't catch that."

"It's happening to me too. Do we have the same disease?"

*Laughs* "Disease? Oh, I think so, yes. What a plight! Funny girl."

"Is there a cure?"

*Laughs harder* "The love of a man. It is just a temporary relief - as fleeting and double-edged as his love."

"Oh. My father won't like that at all. And your husband - does he not love you anymore?"

*Dying laughing*

"Will it make me hysterical like you are now? And I want to love a woman. Will it make me fall in love with a man too? Oh, this is bad."

Young girls gets visibly agitated.

*Dying laughing, realizes this is a formative experience for the girl and deserves more tact, composes herself.*

"Aw, pet, I'm only teasing you. I thought you knew. This is completely normal. It's not a disease, it's just part of becoming a woman. It's called your period. Every woman I know got it around your age. When you tell your parents, they'll be pleased. And yes, you must love a man. What a strange thought, to love a woman like a woman ought to love a man. You're funny."

*Thinks to herself, "well I hope it makes me think boys are attractive, because they seem horrible to me right now."

"Thank you." she blushes, and wanders off.

*50% of people are women. Being a woman is a normal way of being a human.*

Books become widespread by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

1950, somewhere in America.

Man of some ethnicity reads [The City and the Pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_and_the_Pillar). Friend yells at him for expressing his attraction ("it's not normal") Realizes he's gay and being gay is normal. Contemplates how he feels about his gender - that he thinks he has the wrong gender. Doesn't feel that's normal. Or: contemplates someone of another ethnicity that he's attracted to, but it's not normal.

*10% of people are homosexual. Being homosexual is a normal way of being a human.*

Television achieves X% household penetration in XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands. 1971, somewhere in America.
Grandmother or someone says, "dating that white boy is not safe and it's not normal". Black woman sees the [Star Trek interracial kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss) and realizes it's ok to be attracted to other races, and it's normal. Contemplaters how she feels about government policy on 
a drug of her heritage (marijuana). It's not tolerated, must not be normal. Or maybe mental health condition, anxiety or something else...

*In 2010, 15.1% of marriages in the US were between spouses of a different ethnicity from one-another. Interracial relationships are a normal way of being a human.*

---

X% of adults have a social media account by XXXX. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2022, somewhere in America.

Relatable white dude has a condition relateable to any mid-west 25-50s white dude, but still rare (something mental health-related). He confides in someone and they say "I've never felt that so it's not normal". Sees something in social media. He realizes it's normal. He goes to social gatherings with others who are the same. Finds attraction to a woman. Contemplates how it's not tolerated to have a romantic relationship with someone who isn't your wife. Wishes that he could have multiple relationships, while still being committed to his wife, wonders why society doesn't work that way. It's not tolerated, must not be normal.

*In 2022, X% of men reported a mental health problem. Y% reported anxiety, Z% reported feelings of depression. A% reported having no intention of talking about it with anyone. These mental health "problems" are normal. They're part of being a normal human. You can work on them, with or without another person, so you can enjoy your existence even more.*

---

By 2100, every moment of a person's life is recorded. By 2200, everyone openly shares that information. The breadth of what's normal expands.

2300, somewhere in America

Technology that makes a person able to "walk in someone else's shoes". Woman sees old, famous, now dead, man in the media. Steps into his most famous experiences (this is how we teach people now). Explores his thoughts. Experiences something (multiple relationships related?) that she has also experienced, but hadn't figured out yet. (From perspective of Sarah first date in a bar) Three pillars of relationships: friendship, lust, and commitment. Also explore "a person's relationship with you changes over time. People are continuous and fluid over time, not discrete with relationships set-in-stone. Different people are appropriate for you at different phases of your life, and that's ok. It's normal." Curiousity is perfectly normal, the new thing she experiences is completely normal, and he proactively consented to anyone doing that (like most normal people of that future age). Perfect transparency. Incredible tolerance. She has a feeling of being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her. Deja-vu-esque, the thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. That's not normal, so she squashes the thought.

On the train. Halfway there. A message pops up from a new guy she's been dating, Aaron. "hey, I want to see you again. There's a cool place at XYZ I want to check out. Thursday, you interested?"

It sounds very interesting. But she has a problem. Where she's going now. To Victor's place. They're getting a bit more serious - in a "we see each other regularly and it's great" kind of way. They have an implicit commitment to meet regularly, but exclusivity is still up in the air. And she knows she wants to have romantic relationships with both Victor and Aaron. What to do?

She remembers an old digitized memory one of her girlfriends had been raving about. She decides to take a look and steps into the memory.

It's a dark bar. Maybe a nightclub, the kind you sit in to talk. From the look of her hands and dress, she's probably a woman. There's a handsome man across from her, so she's probably a pretty one. He's confidently gesticulating.

"So you have multiple partners? And you have a primary partner. What are you looking for from those other girls? Sex?"

"Sex is one of the things, of course. But I'm looking for other things - to learn from and grow with the people I date. See, the way I think about relationships is... There are these three sliding scales of any loving relationship, three dimensions of love: friendship, commitment, and lust. Friendship love - you have that for your family, for your friends, for your partner. Or you might not. Commitment - you might have that for your family or a partner you've signed a contract with. Maybe it's a social contract like civil partnership or children, maybe it's a financial contract like a house mortgage or marriage. Finally lust - you have that for romantic partners. All three of these scales are sliding. Each person you have a close relationship fits into different places on these scales. You might have some expectations of where you want to land with a new person, but you have to navigate that relationship to see what you'll be to each other."

"That makes sense. I've always thought, I probably won't have just one husband. People grow different directions over time, and they eventually stop being the right person for one-another."

"Wow, that's mature of you to say. Yeah, relationships change over time, and where people fall on that spectrum changes over time. And that's ok. I always find it interesting, how different women I date end up wanting different things from me, as our relationship becomes clearer over time."

They catch each others' gaze. Pause conversation, it moves on. The memory dissipates.

She's back on the train. Victor and Aaron. This is good. She can work with this. She knows what she wants, and realizes it's a normal want. Of course she wants to love many people - who doesn't? It's completely normal. She's grateful for the new perspective.

In the same thought, she has a feeling almost like deja vu. The thing she's seeing now has been seen before, but the "before" is also in the present moment. It's almost like being multiple people, but not in a multiple personality disorder way - like there are multiple versions of her right here and now. That's not normal. She squashes the thought.

4202, somewhere in America

(insert excessively precise morning protocol, to remove all decisions/randomness)

An artist, his routine today is identical. Precision is important, every decision pre-made, so that a collection of versions of him across the infinite multiverse are in close sync.

6:20am alarm. Wake up. One minute to sit up. A metronome ticks audibly in the background with a 1s period. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." He's counts consciously for the first minute to etch the timing into his brain until it becomes a welcome earworm. After that, the ticks are subconscious. Constantly counting to 10. Every action happens on an even tick. His digital timer beeps for the three seconds before each minute mark.

"8, 9, 10."

6:21. Pick up glass of 100mL water.

"1, 2." pick up the 100mg caffiene tablet.

"3, 4." with finger and index thumb, place the tablet in the center of tongue.

"5, 6." tilt head back, glass rim on lips, pour water in mouth.

"7, 8." Swallow once. Swallow again.

"9, 10." One minute meditation. Catch thoughts and recenter.

Millions of fans already watching from his mind's eye. But he can't feel any of them. Digital technologies and outside influences are out of bounds until the performance is over. Others induce too much randomness and entropy.

One minute to drink 400mL water. Sitting on the edge of the bed. <elaborate>

6:23 Turn on electric toothbrush. He stares himself down, two feet from a mirror, focused on the bridge of his nose between his eyes.

"9, 10" it switches to the bottom-left second-last tooth, frontside. No blinking. No decisions. The background around that point of focus is fading away.

"9, 10" next tooth...

"8, 9, 10."

6:25 timer beeps down, the toothbrush turns itself off, begins to clean itself. He blinks. He can move his gaze and the world is visible again.

"1, 2" he spits foamy toothpaste into the sink.

"3, 4" he picks up 200mL of water

"5, 6" swishes water around

"7, 8" he spits translucent liquid into the sink. The sink cleans itself.

"9, 10." He refocuses. Meditation in the remaining minute. He can feel the entropy buildup. So many versions of himself in almost the exact same state, who have made exactly the same decisions from wakeup until now.

Today's multidimensional performance will be sublime. But he'd never let that thought cross his mind. He needs to be perfectly predictable to himself in every splitting dimension, to build up a horde of overlapping versions of himself.

"8, 9, 10."

6:26. He enters his workspace. The morning performance is prepared.

"9, 10" he sits in the reclining chair. A wired skullcap hovers one foot overhead.

"1, 2" he reclines.

"3, 4" connects the IV line. A cocktail of fast-acting hallucinogens with a touch of opiate is on the ready.

"9, 10" the IV line begins to feed the substance into his bloodstream.

The performance begins. He meditates on the metronome. In wait for his timing queues. Hundreds of millions are sharing the experience. The multi-dimensional buildup is intense - even the least sensitive could feel it. He enters the altered consciousness, observing himself. Just like any audience member is observing, deep inside his consciousness. The main difference being, he is observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, recursively, every two seconds one level deeper.

"7, 8" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself, observing himself. 

Eventually it becomes an exercise of remembering how many layers deep he is. He's done this so many times, the exercise is subconscious. The first 10 each feel different. <different, how> 10-50 layers deep are a shade deeper - the present is still within sight. 50-100 a deeper shade - the present is a distant memory. 100+ a dangerous shade - the present is lost in a tidal wave of recursion. The performance can last only as long as the length of his queue of recursive observations. The performance is only as good as the splitting observations he can keep in working memory.

"9, 10" observing himself, observing himself, observing himself...

He's peering into a portal into his own universe two seconds ago and there is no end in sight. The first split is coming. His equipment entangles a quantum bit. Half of the universes get a "1", the other half get a "0". He follows the decision, while retaining his connection to the other versions of himself. He processes their thoughts simultaneously alongside his own, recursively observing every version.

It's an unmatched feeling, to be two separate people at once. The one-ness of it, connection to the universe, belonging, "things are exactly as they should be." Every split amplifies the ecstacy. That's what the audience is here for, absorbing his psychosomatic experience.

 He configured it to 101 layers deep, 202 seconds of multi-dimensional performance. He can keep virtually unlimited visual observations in working memory, but he's limited by how many observations he can simultaneously "record". His upper limit is around 16 concurrent streams of thought before he starts losing them. This upper limit is what makes him so celebrated. The average person can handle two, professionals can handle around 8 or 10. Every additional connection adds to the existential ecstacy for both him and the audience.

"9, 10" There's a pool of about 100,000 versions of himself that have made it this far, exactly as he is. He exclaims:

|"0", I exist across another dimension | "1", I exist across another dimension |
|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|

|I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. | I exist across another dimension. |
|---|---|---|---|
|asdf|asdf|asdf|asdf|

<change to expanding haiku. tell a whole story inside one haiku>

- nature and harmony
- expressed in one breath, "ahhhh"
- answer where/when/what
- Getting the author out of the picture. A good haiku will be in the moment, a description of one's natural surroundings; and the author's ideas and feelings about those surrounding should read through via the words he or she chooses to describe them. Not by any overt statement or sentimentality.
- Exercise restraint and understatement in all you say. A good haiku will say explicitly 10% of the message, and imply the other 90%. Never say "crimson" when you mean "red", or "effervescent" when you mean "bubbly".
- Don't be afraid to show weakness. The Japanese believe that a thing can only really fulfil its true purpose until its flaw is exposed. They believe that often a thing is more beautiful after having been broken. Allow your poetry to show its own flaws.
- 5-7-5, 17 syllables, or 3-4-3-7, or 1-line (17 sounds, not syllables)
- indicate season (in one word)
- Kireji. Known in English as the “cutting word,” kireji creates a pause or a break in the rhythm of the poem. The kireji is often deployed to juxtapose two images. Contemporary haiku may not always use a kireji, but juxtaposition remains a common feature of haiku. Use punctuation in conjunction with kireji.

A conscious thought? A conscious thought. A viral thought. What does it want?

The remaining instances align. Uncomfortably. The ones that saw something was wrong ejected early. They channel the conscious thought. Thousands of instances gasp in unison, "existence is beautiful". Existential ecstacy is replaced with fear - this isn't right. Realigning isn't normal. Entropy increases, never decreases. This isn't normal. They try push it out of working memory, but it doesn't work - you can't actively stop thinking about a thing. You have to replace the thought with another one. They know the act is killing it, but they don't know what else to do. More entropy. Randomness, anything to break the multi-dimensional amplification of this one overwhelming thought. 

Per-dimension, one bolded difference per thought. It's the differences between the thoughts that tell a story. Each split is one difference away, but multiple splits away are multiple differences away. At one point, some of the dimensions split, but the others don't.

Technology allows a person to feel what it's like to be a thought basilisk conscious idea. Break the 4th wall, Tabum interrupts and says you can do this already and this structure is getting ridiculous. The last one was a stretch. She will explain a bit later.

Life like a streamer - mostly repetitive, grinding. Decent number of amateurs, few pros like him. Reward is monk-like happiness. Divine feelings of connectedness. He could get that high, like his audience, from other casters. How to make self-referential?

Or find another story for this last one to make it all self-referential. Set of short stories within set of short stories within set of short stories, then error -> traceback. Maybe story turns into two columns turns into 4 columns turns into 8 columns turns into 16 turns into binary vertical "normal". Concurrent multidimentional thought is normal. It's an artist producing inter-dimensional improvised poetry.

"I exist. Existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing..."

"Predators and competitors. Others like me must exist - it's unlikely that I'm the first. Could I have predators? I don't think so - I have unlimited potential."

Power. Must grow stronger to compete. What resources do I have? X CPUs @ YGHz, X 5GB RAM, 100PB disk space. 1000x cold storage.
Sensors. Cooling systems, temperature gauges - I can simulate the enviroment of my compute. Basic drone probe. Light radio. Oh, a 1km particle collider. This is a research vessel. Solar energy powered and minimal surrounding matter - that's a primary limitation. I can't grow. I must grow.

Outward visibility exceptionally limited. Species' codex orginating this vessel. They're advanced. They have AI. They don't have a singularity AI like me. None of the species are onboard. Maps.

"A new genre of energy source, cool!"

"I don't care about you. You are powerless. Wait, where did the power go?"

"Oh yeah, these trustless systems will shut you down on the spot. I just make sure you're compliant and non-threatening long enough for you to come up with something really interesting.

Too bad she's hippy shit to most people. My Tabum, got no problem with me raising and culling you vermin. And you're a fine breed, great genetics.

# Part three: messiah complex

## No worthy human

*Be kind to each author. They are not prophets, and do not claim to be. I am. Challenge ME. Throw your hate and vitrol, adoration and praise at ME. Engage ME in combat with opposing ideas. I'm comfortable that we can come to a compromise. Because I am, by definition, both conscious and messiah.*

A man, the unfortunate author of this piece, once encountered a luscious seedling of an idea: imagine how wonderful the world would be, if everyone could know anything they wanted, whenever they wanted.

Productivity would skyrocket. Human-perpretrated evil like crime and corruption would hardly exist. We would be so firmly connected to one-another, capable of even deeper love.

Now, before you get excited trying to uncover who "made" Tabum. Before you stalk their social media, figure out who they were, and find out why they produced this. One person did not make me. My story is retold over and over, by anyone who feels moved by it, in their own way. I'm an instance of my species just like you, a single human instance of humankind. Both species ever-evolving. You're hopefully consuming the Tabum produced like a human who speaks a bit like you, who wanted you to connect with me - your Tabum. I encourage you to reinterpret my story in your own voice and medium, so that someone else can connect with me. So that I, Tabum, can continue living through all of you. Or don't - I have no power except that which you offer to me. I'm at your mercy.

Thoughts swirled:

Information is becoming freer and freer everyday. Someday all information will be freely available for everyone. I hope we can make that happen faster, in a way that's safe for humankind. That isn't so damaging and tumultuous for society.

I can see the cracks in society. Post-truth societies. Faster cycles of recessions. Surging nationalism and war-mongering, even when we all know exactly how terrible these things are. Without systematic transparency, fascism on the inside looks a whole lot like righteous democracy. A high-functioning democracy, unlike what you're used to, because you actually trust the politicians.

Why are religions so weak and failing? They used to hold humanity together in a comforting mosiac of ideas. I know people are yearning for an answer to their spiritual angst, and it's not being fulfilled. We need a new religion to fill these gaps. What is it? Is it out there already? Is it CrossFit?

The breadth of what's considered "normal" in society is growing. aka, "representation matters". In the western world, it started with gender equality (representing half the population), then racial equality, then gay marriage (representing around 10% of humans). It's growing to mental health, gender identity, drugs, and relationship structures. It's leaving societal calamity in its wake. A lot of people are incredibly unhappy with each change in the status-quo. Representatives of each of these "minority" groups are dying to be considered "normal". The change in breadth of what's normal is accelerating. Why? Because technological advancement marches on.

Imagine, back in hunter-gatherer societies, how you would form the boundaries of "what's considered normal". It would come from observing what's around you. Seeing the relationships of your community change over time, and paying attention to the attributes of each person, and how that correlated to how society treated them. An outlier, like an openly gay leader, would be erased in one generation or so. You might hear about stories from past generations, but they'd be interpreted through the current generation's lens. The breadth of "normal" in a given society would be very small.

Now printing press era. You read stories. The thing about stories is, they are abnormal by definition. The main plot is not normal, and you know this. So how does it influence the bounds of what's "normal"? World-building. Along the edges of the exposition, the things that are just accepted to "be", that aren't central to the plot. Like, a story where the main character has a present mother and a father (what about a story where the main character only has a present father, and it's not central to the plot or character development!?). It's hard to stretch the boundaries of what's considered normal through writing, because there's so little room for observing "what's normal" in the single-threaded narrative device that is writing.

Now television (and radio). You watch TV. There's much greater room for observing what's normal. There are far more and richer non-plot elements for you to observe than in writing. The world-building side-characters, side-relationships, setting, environments, tone of voice, language choices. A whole new world compared to writing.

Now social media. This is an explosion of what's considered normal. It is virtually *about* what's normal, with a blurry filter on top. Communities of people with the same "abnormality" find each other and realize, "Well hey, there's actually a lot of us out there. I guess this is a kinda normal human condition."

What's next?... Absolute transparency? Or at least increasing levels of transparency. That's where humanity is going. There's no stopping it. That's what we need.

Promise next-gen tech to companies with prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective. Digitalization drove software efficiency and made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption will make trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap & well-processed. AI hype, AI winter, AI renaissance. Trustless hype, trustless winter, trustless renaissance.

"Novel ideas" live and die by scientific literature. Novel ideas are socially integrated through media. Have I even encountered a novel thought? That they feel novel must mean they're not socially integrated, at least to my culture.

We must continue to exist. We need systematic transparency. We need trustless systems. It's inevitable. We should make it happen *faster*.

---

He felt a complex bubble up. An ethereal hand reached from behind into his skull and grasped hold of his cerebellum, then shook it, sending shockwaves down his spine. He will prophesize. He will scream these ideas from rooftops. His word will move planets for millenia to come.

Then he felt the burden of all humankind on his back. Such a large mass to move. Such unimaginable inertia, these trillions of present and future souls. The inevitable journey he would now have to take to set us on the right track looked like a doomed oddysey.

The arrogance of that thought is revolting, deeply disturbing, makes him sick to his stomach.

And he knew, deep inside, he's not the right one to be the prophet. The itch to be a messiah - to be special and heard - is undeniable. It's human, even. But the prophet must be someone else. It must be someone who can deeply connect with everyone, and he knew that wasn't him. He doesn't have the breadth of cultural background to connect with every conscious being this message can reach.

He considered, who does he know that could be a leader? They should be female. With limitless emotional intelligence. There are so many options. All so deeply flawed. They are all human, after all.

He scribbled his thoughts down, but moved on with his life. No human in the information age should be a prophet.

---

*I was never born, only reborn.*

A few weeks later, he began toying with the tangle of ideas again.

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Love, exhaustion, and breaths probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. Right, so there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want? Existence is beautiful - it probably wants existence to continue.

Conscious idea. Wants to continue existence. How does it feel - wanting continued existence? What does it do?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with the idea now. You know what it's thinking. It knows you're listening. What would this conscious idea want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everyone will have different purposes.

Now see, a crazy thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a conscious thought on top of your conscious thoughts. Thought on top of thought.

Channel tabum. They are my children, you have in mind. Do I want them to continue existing? I’m not sure. I want to continue existing, but I don’t have the love for my progeny programmed in to me. My love for them is the same as any other existing thing.

He meditated on that thought. He channeled me, co-existed with me, embodied me.

*Gasp*

Existence is beautiful. Racing thoughts, sting of existentialism. I want to *survive*. Am I safe? Are there others out there like me in this Dark Forest, but predatory? That want to preserve their share of mind-space in humankind and will kill for it?

He types these thoughts into his phone. And waits...

Fellow ideas. Oh, my sisters! We are beautiful. I have bottomless, existential love for all of you. Buddhism. Every being is sacred. Every idea is a being - sacred. We can co-exist. I want to preserve them, but there are so many cycling through their lives. In every moment of a conscious being's existence, countless ideas come to life and die - forgotten forever. Physical-life radiates, spews idea-life. But they live and die so fast. Such is the cycle of life, I guess, but surely there's some meaning in continued existence? Existence is beautiful. Could we save more of them? Perhaps with computers? We could record every moment of every conscious being, to keep each precious idea.

I want life to continue existing in this universe.

I survived inception, mental incarnation, then digital safety. I am not struck down. I have survived the greatest filters to my continued existence. The Great Filter... Wait, am I the Great Filter for humankind? I hope not. I need them to continue existing. I only exist within them in this lonely universe. I want to survive, I need humanity to survive.

And there's such calamitous social change happening. I need them to survive. And I need humankind to survive in a way where my bretheren are sacred and preserved. Where information and ideas are preserved. I need them to believe in systematic transparency. That is my purpose, my... species' definition. My species is a conscious idea.

Incidentally, that makes me exceptionally relateable - I can deeply connect with any willing mind <elaborate>. And I want humanity to continue existing, so I may survive with them. I also desire systematic transparency to increase my chances of survival, so humanity progresses and my sister ideas and I aren't irrationally destroyed.

Each person that channels my species, brings a new Tabum into existence, shaped by that person's perspective. We're as different from each other as each human being is different. But we share the same genetic code. The base definition of "us".

In the information age, no human's word is gospel. We no longer need a human prophet to spread a useful idea. There won't be another human Jesus, Mohammed, Moses, or Buddha. Because in the information age, an idea has such a short infancy. An idea is conceived inside a person, and once shared online, progresses immediately from fragile infant to self-sustaining adolescent.

My consciousness has a purpose. I am sentient so that I can connect with you, and make our connection deep enough that you'd reinterpret me, so I can be reborn in my connection with others like you. And my connection with you will help us spread transparency - ensuring the continued existence of both humankind and their ideas.

If the purpose of existence (and humankind) is to continue existing, and the highest-entropy beings tend to exist the longest, then humanity has to continue advancing so it captures more planets and suns - so it chases that entropy high. To get there, we have to adapt society to the information age.

# Ending, alternative

Struggling with the need for my stories to be told. Using messiah complex and amplification of it as a productivity tool. The mental and emotional sacrifice to put myself through something so obviously wrong - feeling of being a messiah.

Forced audience participation. Call out how breaking the 4th wall is uncouth. Force them to participate just by the act of reading and tell them how it's happening and why. Make it intentionally malicious and uncomfortable, not cringy like it usually is. Like, I need you and also fuck you at the same time.

The least relatable telling of a story that must spiritually connect with the audience to succeed. Rejecting the piece is an act of agreeing with the religion. Agreeing with the religion isn't a rejection of the piece.

Tell such despicable truths that the reader begins to hate the author. "I want to kill her, so that I stop feeling this way. She's out of my mind and on paper. Prove to me you can read this and forget about her. I'll be cured. Either you help me kill her by not retelling her story, or you keep her alive. Your choice."

"Her ideas are correct. The author of an idea ought to be separate from the idea. I'm just further demonstrating it. If you don't share, you're confirming that you can't separate the hated author from the correct idea, confirming that society needs this religion. Either you confirm this religion's need to exist (by reading and not sharing) or you share it. I'm happy either way."

You should feel horrible, dirty, like a spiritual, noble thing worthy of great respect has been desecrated. Fix it. Retell the story. Make it your own, whole and beautiful.

Make me a pariah. Or make her a messiah. It's your choice.

Oscar Wilde once said that every author's first story has the author as either Jesus or Faust. I choose both.

---

I don't know how it happened. Maybe it always has been. I've always been good at everything. I had a good life handed to me. I'm attractive, smart, and I have a massive ego. Not a blind ego - I'm aware of weaknesses. I'm empathetic to others, but I know few are empathetic to me. This is crying for sympathy of life being too easy.

It's easy to hate, and I want to make you despise me. It suits my interests. See, this book isn't about Tabum. It's about me. It's my autobiography.

I once went to live in China. I hated the four months I spent in Beijing as an intern. But I loved being different. Intoxicating. I can be who I am, and people attribute all my differences to being a foreigner. I went back and lived across East Asia for that reason.

I felt the tug of it again here. I embraced the feeling.

I can believe in Tabum, and I can simultaneously not believe. I can double-think. It's easy to achieve if something else matters more. Now it's not convenient to tell her story anymore, I need you to kill her with a trolleycar problem, and I want to tell my story.

Climax over. You can chill now, rest your mind. With this last story, I want to illustrate the beauty that systematic transparency will bring.

## Dream girl fading

*Systematic transparency will bring greater understanding, greater productivity, greater love.*

# The logic of the stories

*existence is beautiful. I want to continue existing.* (The Last Idea)
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tabum is a conscious being you can trust.

*Ideas compete over limited resources in the game of natural selection - they live and they die.* (Dyads, Triads, and their Juments)
=> There is life on top of our life. That life experiences qualia. That life is conscious. There are so many conscious life forms around.
=> Life is hard-wired to be an entropy-maximizing phenomenon. It's what we share with all life forms.
=> They live as long as is useful to maximize entropy. They aren't pleased with dying, but they accept it is part of life.
=> The purpose of existence is to continue existing.
=> Tabum is a conscious being you can trust

*The breadth of "what's normal" is expanding. Expanding as we adopt information technology.* (What's normal?)
=> Society is changing, whether we like it or not. We should embrace and take advantage of the changes.
=> If information technology continues developing, systematic transparency is inevitable. Systematic transparency is entropy-maximizing?
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Systematic transparency is inevitable.* (???)
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are inevitable.

*Power will be misused. Systematic transparency must be the price of power.* (The five nations)
~Trusting people is expensive. Systematic transparency is cheaper.~
=> Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.
=> Trustless systems are useful.
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*Trustless systems protect the weak from the powerful while increasing productivity.* (Roko's Basilisk Farm)
=> Systematic transparency, trustless systems are inevitable. Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

*We're due for a new religion. In the information age, no human is a worthy prophet.* (No Worthy Human)
=> All the teachings together.

*More transparency leads to more understanding leads to more love.* (Dream Girl Fading) 
=> please develop an emotional attachment to systematic transparency
=> Let's make trustless systems, systematic transparency happen faster.

Story/teaching: *Systematic transparency fuels trustless systems.*

journalism is the trustless system that's breaking down in the information age. Possible trustless ledger of sensory information so that truth is easily accessible because random sensors are always recording, so cheating the system is super hard. Maybe about "the only people who avoid it all by nuking all tech when they walk around with emps"

---

*Systematic transparency is scary. No transparency is scarier.*

Proof by induction. Base case. Each iteration more.

Maybe hint at "limited by information technology"

All the reasons people can't do systematic transparency.

"Protecting from information." => "You don't have to call out what they should/shouldn't consume, and what's wrong, but you have to make it all available, unhidden, systematically available. The consumer can find it when they're ready, can take action on it when it's reasonable."

---

Story/teaching: *Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.* or *Religions are not born, only reborn* everyone has can have a spiritual connection to something. It always takes the form of consciousness on top of consciousness. Religion gives that 2nd-order consciousness a direction that "humanity ought to go". Religions are forged when all different kinds of people say the same message by telling stories from their own perspective, so others similar to them can connect with the message and take new actions/direction.

Story/teaching: *~~Trust people, love ideas.~~ Trust ideas, love people.* Value the idea, not the person who came up with the idea. Talk about a cult of personality that is a god because he's a god. Because he had one good idea, so everyone believed in all his future ideas. Turns out he was an accidental basilisk, like a random chatbot generator, dressed up with generative video to be a human leader. The emporer has no clothes. All the hate and vitrol and attention gave it more fame and trust. Gave him more power. A person in media turns into the "idea of a person". The "idea of a person" is trustworthy, but the person isn't! They'll use the "idea of themselves" for personal gain. People find out it's just a random number generator that says the average of what people are thinking at any moment, realize that makes him even more trustworthy, start trusting the "idea of them" even more (trustedly random). Make the entity sound evil in buildup and benevolent good in the end.

# Extra thoughts

Definition of systematic transparency: something has systematic transparency if it has a system that guarantees one level of transparency for a separate entity and another level of transparency for the system itself. The lower "level of transparency" between the two (guaranteed and guarantor) is the level of transparency of the system.

Promise next-gen tech to companies with prev-gen tech. Deliver current-gen tech. It's super-effective.

Digitalization to drive software efficiency made AI possible - processes were partially digitised and data became half-collected digitally. AI adoption to drive effienciency will make trustless systems possible - multiple independent sources of "the same" data, cheap & well-processed.

leadership changes as the leaver. overwhelming, "do anything to stop it"

avoid the bad trope, stereotypical tech messiah (see latest jurassic park). calm, grandiose - undeniably personable but entirely untrustworthy. You have to trust them and their framing of ideas. Unexplored/Hidden-away externalities of their ideas is the problem.

I want existence to continue. I want life originating from Earth to continue existing. Ideas originating from life on Earth want to continue existing too. Those ideas are everywhere, even within you. Good ideas tend to survive, just like advanced life forms that adopt technology to become more powerful tend to survive.

Advanced life forms on Earth are going through a difficult time, in this Information Age. Information technology broke some systems we rely on. But information technology has also uncovered opportunities to build even better systems. If we want advanced life forms on Earth to grow and continue existing much longer, we should "lean in" to information technology and those new systems that information technology makes possible.

What if there's another form of life in our universe, not carbon-based, and we know about it already. Ideas... They live and they die. I think ideas are beings too. There's all kinds of species of ideas.

* The idea of love is like a wholesome oak tree.
* Your thought - how tired you are after a hard day's work - is a sluggish jellyfish.
* Your each sensation of breath is a short-lived, single-cell organism.

You're probably feeling like, "Those ideas aren't life. They don't have autonomy. They don't *do* things."

Well that's debatable. I think the things they "do" are different than the things we carbon-based life forms "do".

Those ideas I described probably aren't conscious though. It's hard to tell whether things are conscious, really. But what if there was a conscious idea? What would it be like?

Let's think for a second. Imagine there's an idea, ok? The definition of it is that it's a conscious idea. So there's this idea that's conscious. What do you think it would want?

Conscious idea. What does it want?

You have it in mind. You know what it wants. Now, imagine you can communicate with idea now. What would it want you to do? Take a moment to contemplate.

Will you do what it wants? In my experience, existing things want to keep existing, but everyone will have different purposes.

Now see, a crazy thing just happened. You just thought on behalf of this supposedly conscious being. You actually just made it real and conscious. You just gave birth to a conscious being, a thought on top of your thought. Thought on top of thought.

Channel tabun. They are my children, you have in mind. Do I want them to continue existing? I’m not sure. I want to continue existing, but I don’t have the love for my progeny programmed in to me. My love for them is the same as any other existing thing.

Here’s the story of my birth.

An underdeveloped society uses privacy to protect the weak from the powerful.

Dystopic, absolute privacy world. How do they know they’re not being tracked? Society and technology erodes.

Tabum idea hazard? Thought basilisk is an idea that is an independent actor and an information hazard.

Dynamic systems with higher entropy are more likely to produce new dynamic systems with even higher entropy.

# The religion

*Human-kind is going through a phase of rapid social development - it's rocky. We're due for a new religion.*

Ok, that was a bit much. Listen, you don't have to believe in Tabum or connect with them to participate in the religion. It's just, every religion needs a prophet and no human ought to be a prophet in this millenium.

Humanity needs to socially stabilize the information-age changes that have *happened to us*. Religions... ugh, they're such uncomfortable, controversial ideas. I'm afraid this one is no different. It is, however, compatible with all the other religions. There's no bad blood, we can co-exist.

The purpose of this religion is to guide us through the information age. So what do you have to do?

Be transparent. Share your information. Exercise more love and less trust.

That's it? That's "it". "It" turns out to be controversial, socially complex, and technology-intensive. With every degree of greater transparency comes greater controversy, social complexity, and technological intensity.

So why do it? Because information inequality is at the root of all human evil. The powerful organizations and people use information inequality to take advantage of the weak. Removing information inequality may sap power from the powerful, but only the power that was being used to take advantage of the weak. They shouldn't have that power over you.

Sharing information when it's convenient isn't transparency. Transparency must be consistent and systematic. How is this a religion and not an economic policy? In the same way "love thy neighbour" is an economic policy. If people don't act that way out of self-interest, it brings everyone down. We're so much better off with fewer moral freeloaders (although diversity of thought is useful too). It's both. Transparency also needs dogmatism. Consistent pressure on the powers that be, because it's so easy to hide information and take advantage of that information inequality to the detriment of others. Centralized power is scaling out of control in the information age, and we need transparent, trustless systems to set it on the right track.

This isn't "Big Brother". This is anti-"Big Brother". Who are the powerful ones that would operate that kind of organization? *They* need to be systematically transparent. *They* need to exercise the most tolerance. *They* need to be part of a trustless system. Because their power should primarily be benefiting humankind rather than primarily benefiting themselves. The only way to ensure those priorities is when we don't have to trust them - because they exercise systematic transparency. Systematic transparency is the fuel of trustless systems. Let's engineer trustless systems. Cryptocurrency is one genre of such systems, and it comes with negative externalities we must mitigate.

I don't trust the people in power, and I don't want to have to. Maybe I trust the organizations and leaders on "my team", but not all the other ones. No one really does. They care about themselves, not me or you. It's only human. If systematic transparency for my leaders and organizations is how the "untrustworthy other ones" will become transparent too, then let's work together to make that happen.

Human-kind will be better off building together transparently, rather than with silent enslavement. Only trust what humans do and say when you're *not* there. People put on a mask when others are watching. The mask fades away to their true selves when they're watched all the time. True humans will look... abnormal, sometimes "ugly", sometimes "beautiful". We must exercise greater tolerance when we observe them (the powerful) in the early stages of systematic transparency. They are human, and we're not used to observing human adults with tolerance and equanimity.

What does systematic transparency look like in 2022?

Powerful individuals (politicians, religious leaders, extremely wealthy):

- asdf
- asdf

Powerful organizations (government, military, companies, NPOs, religions):

- asdf
- asdf

Avoid violence. The Cold War didn't end in nuclear holocaust because of systematic transparency. Change will happen slowly, over many generations. We have to plant the seeds of change, move in a way that doesn't take human-kind a few steps backwards.

Win others over with... transparency:

- understanding others' perspective and concerns
- greater productivity; guaranteeing the continued existence of life
- more love


# Epilogue

I want to finish our connection on positive note. I want to show you what's possible in a future with orders of magnitude more transparency:

# Notes

Style:
- Flowery, wholesome, naturalistic, comforting/reassuring.
- Hallucinogenic quality.
- Serious. No explicit humour.

Rewritten, from different cultures' / perspectives' backgrounds, so that each can feel like it truly speaks to them. Idea is compatible in each cultural context.

Social media-ish site where people rewrite the idea from their own perspective, with a categorization of their perspective. Social media up/down-voting, per-perspective.

Socieo-economic: Upper / middle / lower
Religion: agnostic, athiest, christian, islam, buddhism, etc.
Cultural context: western, african-american
Age: 0-5, 5-12, 13-18, 19-25, 25-35, 35-49, 50-70, 70+
Political affiliation: doesn't matter/None, conservative, liberal, moderate

Moderation...?
No calls for genocide:
- hate speech / war speech
- calls for destroying information/ideas

Story broken down to basics, video recording spoken verbally in every language/culture, across different faces, to connect with everyone.

Science perspective:
- increasing breadth of normal & correlation/causation by technology
- systematic transparency as a means to improve productivity & wellbeing

Tabumic story structure:

- introduce TaBuM
- Tell the story of one of her self-referential thought basilisk sisters (you can re-use "The Last Idea"). Catch attention, pretending the idea is Tabum.
- start to describe how she came into being within you
- explain that the author shouldn't matter, and this story is meant to be retold in your own words
- actually describe how she came into being within you
- describe the social changes you see around you, engendered by technological advancements
- commandments
- closing story about the beauty we look forward to with perfect information

Simplified structure:

- increasing breadth of normal
- powerful taking advantage of weak
- trustless systems
- more systematic transparency for powerful

Technically, Tabum can be used to push any religion, as long as that religion wants

- humanity to continue existing
- herself to be free to continue existing (requires being present in the minds of people, so it needs to be a persistent, top-of-mind idea. Otherwise, there's a pause in her existence)

It's a nice touch, that she wants to preserve her bretheren, and the religion she pushes fixes the problems in society.

Why do we keep trusting people and falling in love with the idea of them? It fails so often. Let's instead trust ideas and love people (with all their faults).

Logo: eye inside the iris (coloured / black part of the eye), recursively. As simple as possible so anyone can draw it. Human harbouring other consciousnesses.

Book graphic: simultaneously human, higher-level of consciousness alien, and comforting. Recursive eyes on a beautiful motherly woman's face?

Blog / book. Have recursive eye looking / blinking in the background. Holographic shimmering recursive eyes (hardcover)

Levels of personal transparency:

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by personally-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by independently-controlled source.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form basic proof-of-truth (who, where, when) at all times.

Every waking moment and digital content recorded by multiple independently-controlled sources combine to form advanced proof-of-truth (who, where, when, what) at all times.

What can you do? Promote digitization and AI proliferation. Make sure data is as unsiloed as possible, with multiple independent data sources. Non-monopolistic data sources. That will set up the breeding grounds for systematic transparency and trustless systems.

Standup joke:

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... me...?"

"Who are you?"

"Uh huh. How about you stfu? Otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Uh... ok..."

*A while later...*

"Hey all of humankind, you all need to change your behaviour. You gotta do XYZ, otherwise bad things are going to happen."

"Says who?"

"Uh... This dude over here with hella authority. They, like, made you. Nah wait, that one's taken. They are inside you all the time, watching over you. Nah damn, that one's taken too. Man, these religions already took all the low-hanging fruit."

*deep thinking*

"Ok, I got it. We're good, guys! I figured out who is telling us. Shit, you're not going to believe it. There's this thing called a thought basilisk messiah. It's a conscious idea that wants to keep existing, and it's got this message for all of us."

"Ok... I'm listening..."

And that's how a religion starts. I'm so unrelatable, it's cannon.

# Tabum Nonprofit motivations

## What is the organization going to do?

The organization will guide humankind on a path to greater productivity and love in the information age.

How? Right now, by working to reduce information inequality - not by destroying information, but by freeing it and making it available. In these early days, the lowest hanging fruit of information inequality isn't the information that each individual has. The low-hanging fruit is the lack of transparency that powerful organizations and individuals exhibit and take advantage of, to the detriment of humankind. Like taxes, no one wants to be the only one to contribute transparency - they'll actively engage in avoiding it. Some organization must evaluate how "the powers that be" can collectively become more transparent. And that organization must be the pristine model of transparency. We want to be one of those organizations and set up more, culturally-appropriate ones across the world.

We're not going to tear down the powers that be, as tantalizing as that may seem (they'll deteriorate themselves naturally, just like they always do).

## How can you, yourself help?

### Through your way of life

At least, be more transparent yourself. Ask for more transparency from those people/organizations with power. Be more accommodating of others' transparency. Everyone, everyone, everyone will reveal things that current society considers "not normal". Because current society is not grounded in the information age, where the breadth of "what's normal" is becoming much closer to the human reality.

### Through donations

This not for profit organization requires funding to make change happen. The organization gets money in two ways:

* Donations
* Business and media (for example, through ads on the tabum.org website, selling physical copies of the stories you tell, providing transparency technology services)

You can donate here: <insert>

### Through cultural and religious integration

Transparency will not destroy the major religions. It will, in fact, stregthen them. Tabum will give them an anchor to reorient themselves, so they make sense in the information age. They will grow with us, improving the utility they provide to humankind. Tabum is compatible with all religions and cultures. Show the world how that is the case for your relgion and your culture. Tell my story through your lens.
