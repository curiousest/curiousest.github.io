On the street Soi Taied, scooters buzz and Thai vendors sing "sawadee ka" to passers-by. It's a familiar scene in Phuket. What makes this street special is the genre of tourist attractions. At 5pm, the foriegners walking there sweat onto their sopping-wet shorts, shirtless. An hour or two before, they were dry and walking with purpose to their fitness classes. Soi Taied is informally called "fitness street", a place that has grown organically around a cluster of kickboxing and strength/conditioning gyms.

The more elite strength/conditioning gyms host the attractive people. Fifteen minutes before class, the athletes wait in the gym. It's like a cocktail party reception - everyone is dressed up, no one knows each other, and they just want the event to start. They evolve into a zig-zag line, finding a view of themselves in the gym-length mirror while maximizing personal space. Tan-brown men fidget with their posture to find the best display. They flex their full-body tattoo tapestries, occassionally peeking down to make sure all six abs are at attention. Model men stride in wearing pastel-coloured lululemon athleasure-wear and change one article of clothing at a time. Each clothing transition is fashionable. Their smiles are blindingly white and expensive.

Toned women stretch, drawing from a decade of yoga for inspiration. Their hair is pulled back and their facial beauty is unobscured by makeup, drawing attention away from their intimidating thigh muscles. Makeup-wearing counterparts grasp their hips and stand on one leg with the other knee bent, lips as puffy as their glutes. 

Everyone sips radioactive orange-coloured water from 1.5L bottles like patrons of a too-loud-to-talk bar. The instructor assembles the workout stations, high-fiving anyone within a 2m radius. The instructor chalks down the WOD (workout of the day) on two to three surfaces: a blackboard, the mirror, the wall, or the floor. The athletes huddle around to study the cryptic instructions. With a minute or so before starting the workout, athletes activate their health monitoring devices: smart watches, wrist bands, chest bands. Heart rates accelerate, eyebrows furrow, the class begins.
