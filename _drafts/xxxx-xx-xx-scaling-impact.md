Doing something useful x volume/quantity.
Someone has to do something useful to make an impact. Managers are useful without workers, tools/products aren't useful without users.

Scaling individual contrib impact: make a library/platform/tool that's super useful and makes others more productive.
Scaling mgmt impact: workers waste 20% less time on menial tasks.

Start company
Start a culture (ex: Sapiens book on scale of religion)
