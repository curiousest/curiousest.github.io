I've seen two startups go through defining their values formally. The process is notoriously difficult and the end result is always anti-climactic. Several developers complained when they didn't see more agressive values like Facebook's famous, "Move fast and break things", and instead got values like "Be results obsessed". Upon reflection on that values-defining process with an executive who drove it, he had some deep insights. One of them went something like,

"The values you choose to leave out are just as defining as the values you choose to keep."

Deep insight.

At the outset of my job search, I contemplated the standard interview question, "what are your strengths and weaknesses?". It helped spawn ***this post<link>***, and it caused me to think about strengths and weaknesses differently. Now I think about strengths and weaknesses a bit more like complimentary decisions or values. For every strength, there is a complimentary weakness. For my first few interviews after this revelation, I had to squash the desire to turn the question into a philisophical discussion about strengths and weaknesses.

Some personal examples:

- Because I chose a career in software development, I more emphasis on developing my ability to understand technical systems at the cost of putting less emphasis on developing my interpersonal skills.
- I often prioritize personal improvement over my impact
- I take longer to make decisions, but the decisions I make are generally very thoroughly contemplated

I don't recall companies delineating their weaknesses (except as an excuse when they admit to doing something wrong). They certainly have weaknesses and are aware of them. 

A defining characteristic of emotional intelligence is your ability to leverage your own emotional state to communicate outbound more effectively. This is a particular area where I would like to grow more, and when I read a Mark Manson post about emotional intelligence <https://markmanson.net/emotional-intelligence>, one point stuck with me.

"INFUSE YOUR EMOTIONS WITH VALUES". 

And it made me realize I hadn't sufficiently explored my values.

## What I overvalue:

- Continuous personal improvement
    - Opportunity to work on things that improve me
    - Feedback/Mentorship/Coaching
    - The improvement has utility
- Harmonious collaboration
    - Deep collaboration
    - Minimal conflict
    - 
- Understanding systems
    - Transparency such that information is possible to access
    - 

## What I undervalue:

- Impact
    - Delivering results
    - Intrinsic rewards from witnessing the impact
- Completeness/Perfection/Correctness

What I undervalue feels so controversial. Those undervalues seem like glaring weaknesses.

What reader should be convinced of after reading:
1. Undervalues are as important as values
Others:
- There is utility in defining your values
- For every strength there may be a complementary weakness
-
