So... the purpose of this blog is to appease my family / friends who want to hear of my travels abroad. I wanted to micro-blog with Twitter, but it doesn't really suit the purpose of telling a story. <div><br /></div><div>And two stories:</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline" class="Apple-style-span">First!One</span></div><div>Why is the url fuzzydough?</div><div><ul><li>dough = doug h = Doug Hindson (I think of it as baking dough, not $$)</li><li>dough was taken</li><li>I'm currently interested in fuzzy logic and fuzzy is a fun word; fuzzydoug was taken</li><li>So fuzzydough: not taken, hurray - and if dough was fuzzy it would feel pretty neat in your hands...don't think of mold</li></ul><div><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline" class="Apple-style-span">First!Two</span></div><div>Today I taught my **yr old grandmother how to use email (gmail). She had never before used a web browser, MS word, or any text manipulation program before. She was basically computer-illiterate, and had only used a computer before to play solitaire. It was a surprisingly enlightening experience. </div><div><br /></div><div>I made sure to let her do all the tactile doing. I started by getting her to open internet explorer. I then told her to click in the box at the top (address bar). She couldn't find it. Then I pondered about how unintuitive it is to navigate the whole internet through textual addresses. I pointed to it and she found the box. I told her to delete the text. She stopped for a while, then tried dragging the text out of the box. It didn't work.</div><div><br /></div><div>We eventually got the <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">gmail </a>page, and I cringed at the clutter. I told her to ignore all the junk and guided her though the login process (I already made her an email account; can't imagine going through the account creation process). From there we continued to adventures of reading and writing emails.</div><div><br /></div><div>Some important learnings I took away:</div><div><ul><li>every web page is covered with text and boxes, so telling a computer noob to 'click in the white box' or 'click on the text on the left' could result in anything</li><li>natural user interfaces are the way to be; desktop computing is the most out-dated (past its time) modern technology</li><li>granny only reads the first 2-3 words of written instructions</li><li>even **yr olds are capable of becoming computer-literate</li></ul></div><div>**a platinum number and age</div><div><br /></div><div>-dough</div></div>
