<span style="color:#000000;">Good luck reading... </span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">I'm feeling a disjointed post today because I just finished hacking at my keyboard for a few hours, slaving over</span> <span style="color:#3333ff;">PDEng, Professional Development for Engineers, is a series of courses designed to teach engineering students at the University of Waterloo about ethics, professionalism, team work, conflict management, and project management, among other topics. Students are forced to pass five courses to finish their degree. The gruelling tasks they are required to perform to pass the courses include (in a particular order) conjuring multi-1000-word reports on desert material, failing every assignment due to an error in one of 50 marking categories, bulimically shedding rage while writing arguments outlining why the marker was incorrect(incompetent), ==>(w)rite/rage/rant/repeat==> force myself back to a story==> </span><span style="color:#000000;">that unmentionable stuff.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">Three weekends ago, I went to an electric devices shopping district</span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Zhongguancun is craaaazy different than North American shopping places, but appears similar from the outside - will talk about in a later blog</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#000000;">and bought a few things. One of which was</span> </span><span style="color:#ff0000;">I've watched 5 seasons of House in the last 2 weeks. 110 episodes of House. 82.5 hours of House. ~3.5 entire days of House. wow... I didn't think it was that much until now... weird how after watching ~10 episodes straight, the characters feel more real than you and the show's setting is more natural than your reality. enough introspection==></span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the T.V. show House. It's a pretty good show.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">Two weekends ago, I went to</span> <span style="color:#009900;">stuff there is huge! pretty unnecessary too... pretty sure they didn't have tanks, so they probly didn't need 10m-tall doorways; wateva. It's impressive like the CN Tower... Posting + pics for this one to come up too==> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Forbidden City.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">This weekend, I</span> <span style="color:#993399;">this is probably the best thing I've done yet. I'm so happy I did this. It was a long time coming, and will have a great impact on the future of all my posts...loud foreshadowing==></span><span style="color:#000000;"> bought a soccer ball.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;">-d<span style="color:#3333ff;">o</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">u</span><span style="color:#33cc00;">g</span></span><span style="color:#cc33cc;">h</span><br /><span style="color:#cc33cc;"></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">p.s. I was going to post the number of words in the title of the posts (with contractions as 1 word and T.V. as one word), but I felt the number was inappropriate for a subset of my readers and not really my style... my train of thought: "1,2,...,51,52,..., aaand, what!? as if..."</span>
