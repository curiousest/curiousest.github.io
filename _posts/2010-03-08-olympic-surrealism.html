<p>Start the weekend expecting a slow and eventless time cuz there’s nothing planned and internet connectivity disappeared on Thursday in my hotel room. A shiny Saturday passes without much significance, bringing the expected arrival of Sunday morning (haven’t lost a day in two weeks - awesome). Go outside to juggle and I find myself going somewhere. </p>  <p>The subway seems the right place to go – I figure I’ll check out the place I watched the fireworks from at night, but in… smoglight. I miss the right station by two stops and get outside to see amazing structures all around and a distant hill across a frozen lake. Signs say I’m at the Olympic Green. The ‘mountain’ in the distance apparently has the best view in Beijing. Desiring to see this view for myself, I head around the lake and up.</p>  <p>Claim holds true; the view is amazing. Skyscrapers are dwarfed by the Bird’s Nest and other structures. The impossibly long Tianchen Road dwindles into a foggy distance. Alas this view is static and my interest is no longer held. I march back down the mountain to look at some places along the lake I spotted from the height.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh6.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF3WV77DI/AAAAAAAAACg/B3-UbFGB_uk/s1600-h/IMG_1269%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1269" border="0" alt="IMG_1269" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF4C-t-hI/AAAAAAAAACk/tao7LehYqR0/IMG_1269_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="436" height="336" /></a> My camera doesn’t approve of smoggy fog. Those big buildings are actually more than 2km (30min walk) away from the grass.</p>  <p align="left">Back to the Green after getting lost in the forests around the lake. Walking towards the distant colossi, things start getting odd. Feels like a combination of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoAwlBojovc">this short Looney Tunes</a> vid with more Daliesque figures set to a dismal grey background. Wavy overhead beams push me out to the infinite road where I find myself lost in a myriad of 20people-tall pillars jungled with golden trees.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF437W3BI/AAAAAAAAACo/jDk6FFkJA5c/s1600-h/IMG_1283%5B5%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1283" border="0" alt="IMG_1283" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF58UVDwI/AAAAAAAAACs/fc3n61WcpWw/IMG_1283_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="441" height="343" /></a> Unexpected forest of pillars.</p>  <p align="left">Wade through the thickens, finding fewer goliath-pillars and gold-tree bushes as I go, then happen upon some fruit. Fruit more massive than me is held by a hand taller than me. What a different experience thisis.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF63M-qqI/AAAAAAAAACw/PVY3guXboGE/s1600-h/IMG_1286%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1286" border="0" alt="IMG_1286" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF7tYs2MI/AAAAAAAAAC0/wa7zJHBQFnQ/IMG_1286_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="438" height="337" /></a> They look too poisonously green to be tasty.</p>  <p align="left">Continue on, finding structures replacing the off-nature. Sign says the grass is smiling at me, but wants me to go away… Under roads and over tunnels until I reach a courtyard. A courtyard filled with hordes of horsemen clamoring up stairs and over benches.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh6.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF8Wrz1XI/AAAAAAAAAC4/KBiUbCIqYJs/s1600-h/IMG_1291%5B3%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1291" border="0" alt="IMG_1291" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF9L065jI/AAAAAAAAAC8/ur2Kl2A7q48/IMG_1291_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="433" height="331" /></a>“More careful, less hazard.” </p>  <p>Getting deeper into the recesses of Olympic magnificence, strangeness now completely encompassing. A town of rods and disks exist soundlessly on my left.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF9516IUI/AAAAAAAAADA/h8PSOFOVWPg/s1600-h/IMG_1294%5B9%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1294" border="0" alt="IMG_1294" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF-vOrN4I/AAAAAAAAADE/084jHASi3bE/IMG_1294_thumb%5B5%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="441" height="345" /></a> The binary abacus.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>Walk through the smalltown and I’m flanked by two immense walls, one of dots and the other of metal bells and contraptions. </p>  <p align="center"><a href="https://lh4.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UF_go8rFI/AAAAAAAAADI/r3UqkVPWBaw/s1600-h/IMG_1303%5B5%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1303" border="0" alt="IMG_1303" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S5UGAVhqeDI/AAAAAAAAADM/RM5xmK7zZ60/IMG_1303_thumb%5B3%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="449" height="349" /></a>The right spotty wall. </p>  <p>Hundreds more such sights to document. Enough to fill a photo album. Slender synchronized flutists, still frames of a running man, and more walls missing playshapes. Blue-purple little people clean all the place, but with no effect on the dulling opaque overhead looking glass of smogfog.</p>  <p>Up the steps and out from my journey past the center of the earth. Gargantuan buildings back in focus, I head in their direction. Stop and stare for a while. They’re big… Continue along the neverending road until I find a subway hole in the ground. Hop in and back home, unanticipated adventure ending abruptly symmetrically.</p>  <p>-dough</p>
