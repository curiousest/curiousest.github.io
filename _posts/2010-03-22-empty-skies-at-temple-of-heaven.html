<p>Internet tells me the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_heaven">Temple of Heaven</a>, Great Wall, and Summer Palace are the major attractions of Beijing that I haven’t yet visited. The wall is far and it isn’t sunny enough for a Summer Palace visit, so temple itis.</p>  <p>Down, subway, and out. Windy and cloudy as it can get, the day could only get more miserable with rain. Follow some other foreigners who look like they know where they’re going (where else would they go but the nearby tourist hotspot). Walk along a big wall, and they take the pedestrian bridge across the road; away from the suspiciously immense stone wall. I follow and see a distant buildingtop over the wall. Go back to the subway exit and the entrance to the temple grounds is immediately behind.</p>  <p>Through the entrance. Clouds beginning to dissipate. Pass the groups of locals chanting songs. Up a huge ramp and through the 5th layer of walls separating the temple from the city. Skyways clean, the Beijing heavens are the brightest and clearest I’ve seen in three months. View of the temple is amazing. More flights of stairs to the temple for an amazing view of temple architecture and distant city sights.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S6dq_P486xI/AAAAAAAAAEA/kO1gUl9JK0o/s1600-h/IMG_1357%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_1357" border="0" alt="IMG_1357" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_rzKqsXcSUsg/S6drAqFRJAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/Wr0_DtqtUxU/IMG_1357_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="440" height="336" /></a>Lots bigger than it looks.</p>  <p align="left">Down from the temple platform, there’s many more sights within the temple grounds. Including man-made forests – providing the tastiest (tasteless) air I’ve dined on since arriving in China. To and through the nearby palace. Trees all along.</p>  <p align="left">Out and onto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Mound_Altar">the altar</a>, another nice view of the temple. Up and past another ancient-looking building, then I head through the artificial forest. Find a comfortable tree away from crowds, and sit up against it. Hear the distant harmony of chanting. Warm breeze playfully brushes dust up against my torso. Closest to home I’ve felt since arriving.</p>  <p align="left">-dough</p>
