<h4>2005</h4>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: hey, I know most people are scared of you, but I also know that under your mysterious shell hides a wonderful, majestic man</span> </p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: plus I think it’s hot that you have like a billion people</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: you were the one with that sexy IPO last year, rite? wanna go out sometime?</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: yes! I thought you’d never ask!</span> </p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: You must understand, I’m not like other guys. If you want to be with me, you have to follow certain rules. They are necessary for my greater good.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: It’s ok. I know I can change you for the better to reveal a glorious shining knight under your fuzzy shroud. We will be eternal lovers, reigning our internet kingdom with openness and omniscience.</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: hmmm, I would prefer to call us friends with economic benefits ;)</span></p>  <h4>a couple years later…</h4>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: hi &lt;3</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: I was jus talking to some of mi best Western girlfriends: Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia…</span> </p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: and?</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: they said ur being a big jerk and u won’t talk to them</span> </p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: if they don’t want to follow my rules, i dont want them in my life</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: but they’re trying to help you! don’t you see? They want to help you open up. its for your own good. we just want you to be a better person!</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: u dont know what ive been through. I know whats best for me</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: but you even ignore me sometimes… whenever Youtube or Blogger comes up, u block me out. it isnt healthy</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: Why cant you be more like Apple or Microsoft?</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: those sluts!?</span> </p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: they put out without any fuss. whats not to like about them?</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: theyre just gold diggers. they don’t love u. they don’t want to make you better. they don’t want to uncover your magnificence. I do.</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: I don’t want or need to be changed. what dont you understand?</span> </p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: i guess i like u though</span></p>  <h4>2010</h4>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: OMG I CANT BELIEVE YOU DID THAT!!!!!!!!!11</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: what?</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: u pretty much assaulted me and a bunch of other Western girls!</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: no I didnt</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: cmon. someone from china hacked the accounts of chinese dissidents. who else would do that?</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: your accusations are groundless. u have no proof.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: ur such a liar. you and ur stupid great firewall of “shut up world, everything here is fine”</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: no one allows unrestricted flow of content on porn, violence, government subversion, ethnic separatism, religious extremism, terrorism, or anti-foreign feelings.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: stop deflecting! most guys are nowhere near as bad as you, and none of them are as influential as you. you can’t compare yourself to them</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: ive been opening up for three decades now. im gunna keep opening up. it’ll just take time</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: LIAR! AGAIN! youd say that even if you werent opening up. the only reason you opened up was because you were forced to</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: that is not true. anyways, i dont want you Westerners being so involved in deciding how i should act. ur just arrogant bullies trying to twist me into a shape that fits ur desires. I twisted in the 19th century because you thrashed me with your advanced weapons. I will not be abused again.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: there you go with your propaganda again. grow up. wer nothing like that anymore. we just want you to be part of our one unified world</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: ah I see. ur just scared of being dominated by me one day</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: i hate you. i thought you could change. u havent changed one bit</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: ha! you think your 1/3 search share will make a difference? an ocean of girls will fill your pothole of a business in china</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: im leaving u for ur brother, HongKong97. at least he’s classy enough to allow unfiltered search results</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:130%;color:#ff00ff;">g♡♡gle: i hope you’re happy. u just embarrassed yourself in front of the whole world.</span></p>  <p>*g♡♡gle leaves*</p>  <p><span style="color:#800000;">.xXChinaXx.: …but they will never refill that deep hole in my heart with diamonds…</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#000000;">Note:</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#000000;">I came up with this after reading Western news articles and comments about Google’s situation, then reading Chinese news articles on the situation. Both sides call the others' news propaganda. Being a Canadian student in China, I’m beginning to see both sides of the argument. I wrote this trying to be as humorously neutral as possible. Most will only see affirmations of their existing views, but hopefully you've tasted an opposing one.</span></p>  <p><span style="color:#000000;"><b>-dougH</b></span></p>  <p><span style="color:#000000;">p.s. these are the Chinese articles I read (and basically quoted in some of the .xXChinaXx. IM’s)</span></p>  <p><a href="https://bit.ly/cP6hHQ">“Google, don’t politicalize yourself”</a></p>  <p><a href="https://bit.ly/bC62vl">“Can China live without Google”</a></p><p>and if you're interested in how Google works, check out my friend's blog: <a href="https://curiouseh.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/how-does-google-work-part-1/">https://curiouseh.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/how-does-google-work-part-1/</a></p>
