For my first month in Asia, I'm doing a Muay Thai camp at <a href="https://www.rawaimuaythai.com/">Rawai Muay Thai</a>. Muay Thai is a martial art where you strike your opponent with your fists, elbows, knees, shins, and feet. I came to a Muay Thai camp because I knew it would be interesting to learn this new sport, I knew it would get me intensely fit, and I knew I would meet many like-minded/bodied travellers. I came to Rawai Muay Thai because I wanted to be in Phuket near beaches and some nightlife/activities.<br /><br /><div class="image" style="width: 510px;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://imgur.com/LNn8cf0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LNn8cf0.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; text-align: start;">This beach is a 5min drive from camp.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.phuket-info.asia/" style="font-size: 10px; text-align: start;">Image source.</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="caption"><br /></div></div>The training layout is Monday-Saturday, 4-8k run in the morning, train with trainers 730am - 930am and 3pm - 5pm. Both training sessions follow the same format:<br /><br /><br /><br /><li>Warmup</li><li>Shadowboxing</li><li>1-1 hitting a trainer wearing training pads / practise on punching bags</li><li>Drills / Sparring</li><li>Stretch</li><br /><div><br /></div>This is what the hitting pads looks like:<br /><br /><div class="video"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QdEn8KYHDFg/0.jpg" height="360" width="510"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/QdEn8KYHDFg&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="510" height="360" src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/QdEn8KYHDFg&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><br />Many people train as much as their bodies allow, eating / living as healthily as they can. Many people train up to once a day and experience the rest of what's happening in Phuket - world class beaches, decent nightlife, diving, food / culture, paintball, shooting ranges, etc. Both can be enjoyable lifestyles, but you have to respect the tenacity of people training 4-8 hours every day.</div>I was fit when I arrived. For the three months prior to coming, I was going to the gym for 1hr, 3-4x/week, and doing 5k in under 28min without any effort. Still, my fitness isn't comparable to many here and I have much to do before I'll be capable of training as intensely as I would like. The training is exhausting: I didn't do any runs this first week so I could be functional enough to do work in my offtime. The heat (28-35C + humidity) is exhausting: I drink 2L of water during each training session, 4-6L of fluid/day. The workouts take a toll on your body: I've gotten blisters on both feet and hands, a bruised knee, elbow, and shin, a swollen ankle, and heavy overheating. The reward for all this stress is a swell in knowledge and muscle.<br /><br /><div class="image"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://imgur.com/nqKxLP6" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="" height="360" src="https://i.imgur.com/nqKxLP6.jpg?1" title="Hosted by imgur.com" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; text-align: start;">My muay thai gear.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="caption"><br /></div></div>My improvement in strength, physique, and especially technique is noticeable after one week. I've always been an athlete, but a week ago was my first time hitting a punching bag and I've never come close to being in a fight. After getting enough technique down, sparring is fun - getting inside of your partner's head, trying to figure out what they're going to do, then reacting to what they actually do.<br /><br />I hope to train every day for the next three weeks. My body may not agree.
