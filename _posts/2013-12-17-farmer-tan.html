<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I did a week-long bike tour through rural and mountainous South-Western China. There were two other Canadians with me and our tour guide, Farmer Tan. Measuring in at ~5ft tall, Farmer Tan was a farmer in a village near to the city of Yangshuo before he became a tour guide. He was incredibly well-meaning, unintimidating, and eager to please us. During a dinner in Butterfly Valley, we had a charming conversation.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zCcVyKTY4w/UrDB0_Tj9OI/AAAAAAAAASc/KYde-hMwEys/s1600/IMAG0857.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zCcVyKTY4w/UrDB0_Tj9OI/AAAAAAAAASc/KYde-hMwEys/s640/IMAG0857.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The chairs were a foot off the ground and used by adults.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"How long have you been married?"<br /><br />"20 years. I met her June 26 1992 and we got married about a year later."<br /><br />"That's a very exact date."<br /><br />"Yes, I remember it very well..."<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">---</div><br />In my village, everyone was a farmer. My parents were farmers, my brothers were farmers, I was a farmer... I was very little, even compared to my brothers, and this made things very difficult for me. My brothers would try to show me how to farm, and many times I was too small to do things properly. Back when I was 25 in 1992, I was about three inches shorter than I am now. I thought I would never get married. Who would want to marry a short man like me? I can't do work like other men!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ONoQLVfLJyQ/UrDB-VVoUwI/AAAAAAAAASo/ltqMhZGyLTo/s1600/IMAG0816.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ONoQLVfLJyQ/UrDB-VVoUwI/AAAAAAAAASo/ltqMhZGyLTo/s640/IMAG0816.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mountainfuls of rice terraces.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>On June 25, 1992, I was working in my field. Like usual, the water buffalo wasn't listening to me as I was too small to direct him properly. I was struggling with the water buffalo, up to my shins in mud, when three huge foreign men came up to my field: a German, a Dutchman, and a Swiss. They spoke Mandarin and wanted directions. I looked like a mess - I was just over four feet tall in the mud and my shirt sleeves ended well past my fingertips. I talked with them awhile and then they helped me with the plowing. We plowed the whole field! I was so happy!<br /><br />They asked if there was someplace they could eat and stay the night. I brought them back to the house where my family lived and I was very excited. I told my parents and brothers, "they plowed the whole field for me!" They had dinner and stayed the night.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KAK85SFisUM/UrDCAzJ5gkI/AAAAAAAAASw/qa6h9R_NkV8/s1600/IMAG0858.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KAK85SFisUM/UrDCAzJ5gkI/AAAAAAAAASw/qa6h9R_NkV8/s640/IMAG0858.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Misty morning in Butterfly Valley.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The next morning, the foreign men asked me to bring them into the city. They bought me a bus ticket and we went to the market. Because I was so short, the city people didn't realize that I was just a farmer. I couldn't be a farmer. Everyone thought I was a tour guide from the city.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NYBN_y1Dc1I/UrDCvld4roI/AAAAAAAAATI/qBe6i3Ocw1Y/s1600/IMAG0908.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NYBN_y1Dc1I/UrDCvld4roI/AAAAAAAAATI/qBe6i3Ocw1Y/s640/IMAG0908.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">River rafts near Yangshuo.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />That day, my future wife (who was also living a farmer's life with her family) was visiting her aunt in the city. She was intrigued by the foreigners, introduced herself, and had a conversation with them. She invited them to eat and stay with her family and they accepted.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bZQfgrKUT6Q/UrDCaEe7TCI/AAAAAAAAAS4/Ex02A7aO18c/s1600/IMAG0890.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bZQfgrKUT6Q/UrDCaEe7TCI/AAAAAAAAAS4/Ex02A7aO18c/s640/IMAG0890.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Dr. Seuss-esque mountains.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />She asked me what I did for work, and I said that I'm a tour guide! We arranged to meet again.
