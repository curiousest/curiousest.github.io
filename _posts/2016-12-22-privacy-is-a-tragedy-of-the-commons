# Privacy is a tragedy of the commons.

## Not sharing

We want to move humanity forward.

More individuals with higher ability means a better/faster developing humanity.

Ability of individuals is influenced by what information is available to them and their capacity to process it.

Available information (and therefore individual ability) is reduced when others don't share information. There are three important ways information is not shared in our world right now:

1. Individual privacy

This is your privacy that you hear about in the news. It means reducing the amount of information other individuals/organizations know about you. In the news, individual privacy has good connotations.

2. Privacy of organizations and not sharing information they have access to

You don't hear about this kind of not sharing in the news. If you do, it's often how information was shared without their consent. It means not sharing information the organization has privileged access to.

Really, 1 & 2 are the same thing, but individuals have so little information of value that others want, with the exception of information uniquely about them (personal information).

3. Inability to share

There are some technology and cost limitations on information we share. It's hard to share information from the North Pole and it would be unreasonable to have petabytes of weather data available for individual processing. As technology improves, the inability to share is reduced.

## Information inequality

Information inequality means for some context, useful information available to one individual is much less than the information available to another. The individual with more information will have greater ability (available information x processing power), which often translates to greater power.

Information inequality means that sharing information has a cost. Sharing information benefits everyone else, giving others ability and power to others, without immediately gaining any yourself. It's a tragedy of the commons - we all have the ability to give others great value with little effort, but giving that value also gives others power (informational prowess) over us.

Organizations face those costs when sharing. To share information of value they hold on to - it would give others (including their competitors) power over them. Also, organizations currently have little incentive to share that massive amount of information they have. Individuals share information because the benefits are greater than the costs them - getting access to services or making the services they use more powerful is worth the power those services obtain over the individual.

## Gradual increase in sharing

If I shared all the information I have the ability to share about myself - my personal history, salary, bank details, passwords... I would be at the mercy of everyone I shared that information with. Individuals and companies may be able to use that information in a positive and productive way - finding that they should be asking for more/less at their job or knowing my locational history from my phone over the last two years. Someone out there would inevitably take advantage of that mercy and steal my valuables.

BUT

If everyone gradually shared more and more about themselves (not the same thing over time, but more % of the 100% of information one has privileged access to), the power others wield over you would not be so big.

The reflex you should have is not, 
"I must make an effort to share less about myself so I don't get screwed over by some bogeyman." 
It should be, 
"I must know as much as possible about all the bogeymen." 

Make everyone share as much as possible about themselves. Leave no stone unturned nor organization unexposed. The organizations with most power over you should be the first you ask to share. Hacking them to reveal their information, or sharing without permission, is a militant (often illegal) approach, so the real change will be achieved by individuals inside organizations due to the increasing pressure to share information.

If powerful individuals / organizations gradually share more (not the same information over time, but a linear increase in % of the 100% of information they have privileged access to) in lock-step with each other, they also will not yield power to each other. This will happen gradually as sharing attitudes open up, but laws and movements could expediate the change.

## We're experiencing a gradual increase in sharing

You may be more and more aware of what you share, but it's likely that with every year that has passed since your birth, you have shared more of the 100% of information you have privileged access to. That's because information technology has and is developing, and information technology enables information collection and sharing.

<statistics / graphs about increases in sharing>
<historical context about how privacy is unnatural>

And there's much more technological progress we have yet to experience in information collection and sharing:

* The location of every digital device
* The location of every man-made object
* The state of all the tissues in your body
* What everyone is thinking

Sharing these things seems scary, but if EVERYONE shared, it wouldn't be as scary. Others wouldn't have power over you because if they're sharing too, the information inequality won't be there.

## Systems and a perfect world

In a perfect world, everyone would always have the ability to know anything about anything.  (that is possible to know - the answer to life, the universe, and everything may be 42 or it may be hazy).

A system/society that could get us there is one where in order to participate, one must continually share everything there is to know in order to participate.

A toned-down version could be that one slowly shares more and more to participate.

Another toned-down version could be that there are tiers of participation. In order to access some tier of information, one must share privileged information in accordance to the that tier's requirements. (ex: to everyone else's locational history, you have to share yours)

The difficulty with toned-down versions is one can extract information from the system and share it with non-participants.
