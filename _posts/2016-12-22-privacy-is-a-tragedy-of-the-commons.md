WORK IN PROGRESS - DON'T SHARE YET

# Summary

* We will continue sharing more and more information we have privileged access to.
* With some conditions, this is a good thing:
  * The information is as accessible to as many individuals as possible.
  * Individuals and organizations share privileged information equally.
* We should encourage sharing information. In particular, we should ask organizations with power over us to share more.

# Not sharing

We want to move humanity forward.

More individuals and organizations with higher ability means humanity develops more productively.

Ability of individuals and organizations is influenced by what information is available to them and their capacity to process it.

Available information (and therefore ability) is reduced when others do not share information. There are three relevant ways information is not shared in our world right now:

## 1. Individual privacy

This is your privacy that you hear about in the news today. It means reducing the amount of information other individuals/organizations know about you. In the news today, individual privacy has good connotations.

## 2. Privacy of organizations and not sharing information they control

You don't hear about this kind of not sharing in the news. If you do, it's often how information was shared without their consent. It means not sharing information the organization has privileged access to. This information could be data intentionally/unintentionally collected over time, institutional knowledge, trade secrets, etc.

Really, 1 & 2 are the same, but individuals have so little information of value that others want (with the exception of personal information).

## 3. Inability to share

There are technology and cost limitations on information we share. It's hard to share information from the North Pole and it would be unreasonable to have petabytes of weather data available for individual processing. As technology improves, ability to share is increasing.

# Information inequality

Information inequality means for some context, useful information available to one is much less than the information available to another. The one with more information will have greater ability (available information x processing power), which often translates to greater power in that context.

Information inequality means that sharing information has a cost. Sharing information benefits everyone else, giving others ability and power to others, without inherently gaining any yourself. There are situations where sharing information benefits you, but it's because you're getting something in exchange for sharing that information rather than inherently benefitting from sharing - often services or social capital. Not sharing is a tragedy of the commons - we all have the ability to give others value with little effort, but giving that value also gives others power (informational prowess) over us. If everyone shared perfectly, everyone would gain incredible value.

Organizations face those costs when sharing. To share information of value they hold on to - it would give others (including their competitors) power over them. In today's world, organizations have little incentive to share that massive amount of information they control. Individuals share information because the benefits are greater than the costs - getting access to services or making the services they use more useful is worth the power the organizations controlling those services obtain over the individual.

# Gradual increases in sharing

If you shared all the information you have the ability to share about yourself - your personal history, salary, bank details, passwords... You would be at the mercy of everyone you shared that information with. Some individuals and companies may be able to use that information in a positive and productive way. Some bogeyman would inevitably take advantage of that mercy and use that information to steal or extort from you.

BUT

If everyone gradually shared more and more about themselves, the intermediary changes in power would not be so big ("sharing more" meaning not the same thing shared over time, but more % of the 100% of information one has privileged access to).

The reflex you should have is not,

*"I must share less about myself so I don't get screwed over by some bogeyman."*

It should be, 

*"We must know as much as possible about everyone, and make sure that bogeymen also share."*

You may be getting more aware and cautious of what you share, but it's likely that with every year that has passed since your birth, you have shared more % of the 100% of information you have privileged access to. That's because information technology is developing, and better information technology enables better information collection and sharing.

* < INSERT statistics / graphs about increases in sharing>
* < INSERT historical context about how privacy is unnatural>
* < INSERT moore's law-esque thing about how sharing will continue to increase>

And there's much more technological progress we have yet to experience in information collection and sharing:

* The location of every digital device
* The location of every man-made object
* The state of all the tissues in your body
* What everyone is thinking

Sharing these things seems scary, but if *everyone* shares, it won't be scary. Others won't have power over you, as long as they're sharing too.

# Call to action

The whole *"information sharing is increasing and it benefits humanity"* phenomenon is happening and it will inevitably continue to trudge on. Too many individuals are interested in progressing humanity for a few to make it to regress.

Encourage individuals to share in a way that benefits everyone else and doesn't yield too much power to others. Wantonly ceasing from sharing information can be harmful to society, but can also can be used to make organizations share more. 

Encourage every organization to gradually share as much privileged information as possible. Let no organization hide. The organizations with the most power over you should be the first you ask to share. Ask them to share in a way that makes them have less power over you. Hacking organizations to reveal the information they control or sharing without permission is a militant (often illegal) approach. Much of the real change will be achieved by individuals inside organizations feeling increasing societal and economic pressures to share information. Laws could expedite organizations sharing information.

Build and use systems where sharing information benefits everyone, causes the sharer to yield little power to others, and doesn't privately consolidate the information within organizations.

**Note 2**: This perspective originally came and progressed ~7 years ago from an (obviously flawed) idea of a private social network where one must share everything to participate.
