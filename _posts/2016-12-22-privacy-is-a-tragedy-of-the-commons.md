WORK IN PROGRESS - DON'T SHARE YET

# Summary

* We will continue sharing more and more information we have privileged access to.
* With some conditions, this is a good thing:
  * The information is as accessible to as many individuals as possible.
  * Individuals and organizations share privileged information equally.
* We should encourage sharing information. In particular, we should ask organizations with power over us to share more.

# Not sharing

**insert warm, personal introduction here**

The ability of individuals and organizations is dependent on what information is available to them and their means to process and use it. When others do not share information, everyone's ability is reduced. 

Here are three ways information is not shared right now:

## 1. Privacy of individuals

This is the privacy that you hear about in the news today - your privacy. Your privacy reduces the amount of information other individuals/organizations know about you. In the news today, individual privacy has good connotations. These good connotations are curious, considering privacy is a selfish act, but they're well-deserved.

## 2. Privacy of organizations and not sharing information they control

Companies aren't incentivised to share, so they generally don't. The rare news articles about companies sharing information are about how information was shared without the organization's consent. Organizations have vast troves of information, and that data is valuable. This information could be data intentionally/unintentionally collected over time, institutional knowledge, trade secrets, etc.

Information about individuals and organizations are similar, but have a few key differences:

* Information *about* individuals is most valuable to others
* Information *collected by* organizations is most valuable to others
* The information that must be made public about individuals vs. organizations is different

<sub>Aside: imagine a world where all collected information is always shared, and there are complex societal rules about what information is collected.</sub>

## 3. Inability to share

There are technological and cost limitations on the information we share. It's hard to share information from across the universe and we can't process petabytes of weather data on our personal computers. As technology improves, so does our ability to share.

# Information inequality

Information inequality means useful information available to one is much less than the information available to another. The one with more information will have *greater ability* (information x processing power). When another has information about you, and you don't have comparable information about them, that *greater ability* turns into *power over you*.

When others have *power over you*, it isn't always a bad thing. Most governments have a great deal of power over their citizens and hopefully most of their citizens believe that's a good thing. However, trusting those with power over you is an expensive thing. Given the choice between another having power over you or not, with no other considerations, you should choose *not*, because the other can abuse their power to their gain and your loss. The cost of yielding power to others is the risk that they potentially abuse their power. 

The cost of giving your personal information to companies in exchange for services is that they potentially use or sell that information in ways that harm you.

The cost of a publicly traded company having to share their revenues, expenses, and profits is that private ones have a better idea whether competing is worth it. 

Information inequality means that sharing information has a cost. Sharing information benefits everyone else, giving ability and power to others, without inherently gaining any yourself. There are situations where sharing information benefits you, but it's because you're getting something in exchange for sharing that information rather than directly benefitting from sharing - often services, money, or social capital. Not sharing is a *tragedy of the commons* - we have the ability to give others value with little effort, but we then yield power to others (via informational prowess). If everyone shared perfectly, everyone would gain much more value than it would cost them.

Organizations face those costs when sharing. To share information of value they hold on to - it would give others (including their competitors) power over them. In today's world, organizations have little incentive to share stores of valuable information they control. Individuals share information because the benefits seem greater than the costs - the services exchanged are worth the incremental power those organizations gain.

# Gradual increases in sharing

If you shared all your information you possibly could - your personal history, salary, bank details, passwords... You would be at the mercy of everyone. Some individuals and companies might use that information in a positive and productive way. Some bogeyman would inevitably take advantage of that power to steal or extort from you.

BUT

If everyone gradually shared more and more about themselves, the intermediary changes in power would not be so big ("sharing more" meaning more % of the 100% of information one has privileged access to, not the same thing shared over time).

The reflex you should have is not,

*"I must share less about myself so I don't get screwed over by some bogeyman."*

It should be, 

*"We must know as much as possible about everyone, and make sure that bogeymen also share."*

You may be getting more aware and cautious of what you share, but it's likely that with every year that has passed since your birth, you have shared more of that 100%. That's because information technology is developing, and better information technology enables better information collection and sharing.

* < INSERT historical context about how privacy is unnatural>
* < INSERT moore's law-esque thing about how sharing will continue to increase>

And there's much more technological progress we have yet to experience in information collection and sharing:

* The location of every digital device
* The location of every man-made object
* The state of all the tissues in your body
* What everyone is thinking

Sharing these things seems scary, but if *everyone* shares it won't be! Others won't have power over you, as long as they're sharing too.

# Call to action

The whole *"information sharing is increasing and it benefits humanity"* phenomenon is happening and it will inevitably trudge on. Too many individuals are interested in progressing humanity for a few to make it to regress.

Encourage individuals to share in a way that benefits everyone else and doesn't yield too much power to others. Wantonly ceasing from sharing information can be harmful to society, but can also can be used to make organizations share more. 

Encourage every organization to gradually share as much privileged information as possible. Let no organization hide. The organizations with the most power over you should be the first you ask to share. Ask them to share in a way that makes them have less power over you. Hacking organizations to reveal the information they control or sharing without permission is a militant (often illegal) approach. Much of the real change will be achieved by individuals inside organizations feeling increasing societal and economic pressures to share information. Laws could expedite organizations sharing information.

Build and use systems where sharing information benefits everyone, causes the sharer to yield little power to others, and doesn't privately consolidate the information within organizations.

**Note 2**: This perspective originally came and progressed ~7 years ago from an (obviously flawed) idea of a private social network where one must share everything to participate.
