WORK IN PROGRESS - DON'T SHARE YET

# Summary

We share different kinds of information and we share information for different reasons. Sharing gives value to others, but sharing also yields power to others through information inequalities. Too much information inequality is expensive, which means not sharing is a tradegy of the commons. Gradual increases in sharing counteracts the tragedy without introducing information inequalities, and gradual increases in sharing are inevitable. We should still solve the tragedy by other means.

# We share different kinds of information

|                       | Personal information | Other information |
| :-------------------: | :--------: | :----------: |
| The individual  | valuable, often exchanged for services   |   not much of it   |
| THe organization     | valuable, usually shared by law | lots of it, very valuable, rarely shared |

**An individual**: one person.

**An organization**: not *an individual*, but can own information. Ex: a company, a country, a non-profit organization, a government organization, or even an informal fraternity. 

**Personal information**: information *about* the particular individual or organization. Personal information can exist without anyone having access to it. Ex: date of birth, bank records, projected revenues, current locations of constituents.

**Other information**: personal information about others or how the universe works. Ex: the average age of Americans, the formula for coca cola, industry best-practices, customer data, research papers, the weather.

# We share information for different reasons

The ability of individuals and organizations is dependent on what information is available to them and their means to process and use it. When others do not share information, everyone's ability is reduced. 

Ways information is shared:

| | Personal information | Other information |
| :--:| :-- | :-- |
| Shared by law | <ul><li>Census data</li><li>Traffic stops</li><li>Border control</li></ul> | <ul><li>Knowledge of others breaking the law</li><li>Government demands for tech companies' data</li></ul> |
| Shared by contract | <ul><li>Email address for online services</li><li>Performance data for mergers and acquisitions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Paid APIs</li><li>Forrester reports</li></ul> |
| Shared freely | <ul><li>Personal photos and videos</li><li>Blog / microblogging posts</li><li>Data within [Data.gov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data.gov) and [Data.gov.uk](Data.gov.uk)</li></ul> | <ul><li>Research datasets</li><li>Wikipedia</li><li>Torrenting</li><li>Free APIs</li><li>Data within [Data.gov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data.gov) and [Data.gov.uk](Data.gov.uk)</li></ul> |


Reasons information is not shared:

* By choice
* Inability to share
* Inability to collect the information in the first place

# Sharing gives value to others

In short, information can be valuable. The value of useful information generally exceeds the cost of processing useless/false information. Information can generally be shared with low cost and consuming it doesn't destroy it.

# Sharing yields power to others

There is information inequality between two individuals/organizations on a topic if one has more useful information than the other about that topic. The two have inequal amounts of information on that topic. 

Generally speaking, the more information you have about a particular topic, the greater your ability will be at things relating to that topic. For example, if you know how much money a company that wants to hire you is willing to spend, you are in much better salary negotiating position than if you didn't have that information. When information inequality exists between two individuals/organizations, the one with more information will have *greater ability*. When someone else has your personal information and you don't have theirs, that *greater ability* becomes *power over you*.

# Too much information inequality is expensive

When others have *power over you*, it isn't always a bad thing. Most governments have a great deal of power over their citizens and hopefully most of their citizens believe that's a good thing. However, trusting those with power over you is an expensive thing.

If you were to pick a random person, and decide whether to give them power over you, you should choose not to. There's no benefit in giving others power over you for nothing in exchange, but there is a cost. The other can abuse their power to their gain and your loss. The cost of yielding power to others is the risk that they potentially abuse their power. 

Examples: 

* The cost of giving your personal information to companies in exchange for services is that they potentially use or sell that information in ways that harm you.
* The cost of a publicly traded company having to share their revenues, expenses, and profits is that private ones have a better idea whether competing is worth it.

# Not sharing is a tradegy of the commons

Sharing information has a cost because it creates an information inequality that yields power to those you shared with. When you share information it benefits everyone else, giving ability and power to others without inherently gaining any yourself. There are situations where sharing information benefits you, but it's because you're getting something in exchange for sharing that information - often services, money, or social capital. Not sharing is a [*tragedy of the commons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons):

> *A situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.*

If absolutely everyone shared as much as possible, it would significantly benefit everyone. Unfortunately, individuals and organizations acting in their own self-interest will generally choose not to share and the benefit is spoiled. Also, when some indviduals or organizations obtain too much information-based power over others, those others will be scared into reducing the amount they share everywhere to reduce the risk of the powerful taking advantage of them. This means **the informationally powerful, just by existing, cause less information to be shared.**  

# Hypothesis: Gradual increases in sharing counteracts the tragedy

If you shared all your information you possibly could - your personal history, salary, bank details, passwords... You would be at the mercy of everyone. Some individuals and companies might use that information in a positive and productive way. Some bogeyman would inevitably take advantage of that power to steal or extort from you.

BUT

If everyone gradually shared more and more about themselves, the intermediary changes in power would not be so big ("sharing more" meaning more % of the 100% of information one has privileged access to, not the same thing shared over time). 

Ex: if all individuals begin freely sharing their hair colour, the sharing ones don't yield much power to the non-sharing ones. Once everyone is sharing that information, individuals begin freely sharing their blood type. If the cycle of `begin sharing something > everyone shares that something > begin sharing something else` continues repeating for all kinds of information (both for individuals and organizations), everyone will have ended up sharing a great deal of information without yielding a great deal of power at any one point in time.

It's important that the information continues to be shared, or power will be gained by those who stop sharing (and those who continue to share will experience the cost of giving others power). This can be induced by law, contract, or social pressures.

The reflex you should have is not,

*"I must share less about myself so I don't get harmed by some bogeyman."*

It should be, 

*"I must gradually share more and more in lock-step with everyone, and make sure that bogeymen also share."*

# Hypothesis: Gradual increases in sharing are inevitable (not_finished)

You may be getting more aware and cautious of what you share, but it's likely that with every year that has passed since your birth, you have shared more of that 100%. That's because information technology is developing, and better information technology enables better information collection and sharing.

* < INSERT statistics / graphs about increases in sharing>
* < INSERT historical context about how privacy is unnatural>
* < INSERT moore's law-esque thing about how sharing will continue to increase>

And there's much more technological progress we have yet to experience in information collection and sharing:

* The location of every digital device
* The location of every man-made object
* The state of all the tissues in your body
* What everyone is thinking

Sharing these things seems scary, but if *everyone* shares it won't be! Others won't have power over you, as long as they're sharing too.

# We should still solve the tragedy by other means (not_finished)

The *"information sharing is increasing and it benefits humanity"* phenomenon is happening and it will inevitably trudge on.

Still, we must take care that the amount of information each individual and organization shares is balanced, so that everyone minimizes the costly risk that others will use shared information to the sharer's detriment. In particular, organizations are hoarding large amounts of *[other information](#we-share-different-kinds-of-information)*, and some of it is personal information [citation needed]. Those organizations aren't sharing information to counteract the power they are gaining over others [citation needed]. That means the individual and organizations making the world a better place by sharing personal information are suffering the costly risk that the hoarding organizations will use that personal information to the sharers' detriment.

We must also design systems and societies to encourage sharing information while keeping a balance of yielding power to others. Freely shared information benefits everyone more than information shared by law, which benefits everyone more than information shared by contract, which benefits everyone more than not sharing information.

Here are some ways systems and societies can encourage sharing information:

* In order to access shared information, you must share information yourself
* Types of *other information* must be shared by law
* Everyone knows what personal information about them is shared and who has access to it
* Anyone can retract shared personal information that others have access to
* Individuals / Organizations with too much information-based power must share until that power is balanced (or powerless individuals / organizations gain information-based power until that power is balanced)
* Information can't be extracted from the system / society
* Increase the value exchanged for information shared by contract
