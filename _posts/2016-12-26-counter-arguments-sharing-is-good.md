# 1. In the distant future, what about X?

# 2. Information processing power

# 3. Sharing false information

This is reducible to #2 (information processing power).

# 4. Will this decrease diversity?

It may. It may not. Either way, it will be worth it.

We currently lack societies with exceptional abundances of sharing. Those societies are technologically and sociologically difficult to build for the first time. If we end up lacking societies where there is little sharing, it would not be as hard to recreate them for the sake of diversity.
