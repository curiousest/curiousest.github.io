In a perfect world, everyone would always have the ability to know anything about anything.  (that is possible to know - the answer to life, the universe, and everything may be 42 or it may be hazy).

A system/society that could get us there is one where in order to participate, one must continually share everything one is capable of sharing and has privileged access to.

A toned-down version could be that one slowly shares more and more to participate.

Another toned-down version could be that there are tiers of participation. In order to access some tier of information, one must share privileged information in accordance to the that tier's requirements. (ex: to everyone else's locational history, you have to share yours)

The difficulty with toned-down versions is one can extract information from the system and share it with non-participants.

A system that could achieve those requirements could be a public, decentralized store of information, where the act of accessing information in the store produces new information in the store (like the internet + blockchain). Imagine if all information digitally shared by humanity was available on this ledger.
