WORK IN PROGRESS

A year ago I went on vacation and realized I had significant tension and pain in my shoulders and back. The pain was caused by my posture, programming at my desk all day. In particular,

* slouched-forward posture curving my back and neck
<sloched pic>

* tensing forward/inward tightening my chest muscles

I decided that I would fix it.  

## Standing desk

A standing desk fixed my slouched-forward posture problem.

I had tried a standing desk before (along with everyone else in the office), but found I couldn't stand all day. I would gradually begin sitting 25% of the day, then 50%, then 75%, then 100%. Another colleague, @Manoj, had a genius idea. He was using a standing desk, but he purchased a balance board to keep him moving around while standing. I immediately copied him and iterated, adding a standing mat on top of it. After digging a small hold in the wooden floor, management asked me to iterate again, and I stuffed an old shoe underneath.

The balance board didn't make it possible to stand all day, but it helped. I often had to half-kneel, half-stand at my standing desk to be able to stand all day. People made memes.

## Two keyboards

Two keyboards fixed my tensing forward/inward, tightening my chest muscles problem.

Placing my hands together in front of me on a keyboard was curving and tensing my upper back and shoulders. My first inspiration for freeing myself from this tension was seeing my colleague, @Oaten's, split keyboard.

I looked online for the keyboard and found that it was unreasonably priced - £80. I knew I could two of my old bad keyboards for free, so I did. 

I placed the two keyboards on top of my standing desk, but they didn't fit side-by-side, along with a laptop and a monitor. The solution was to either get a bigger desk or get smaller keyboards. I decided to cut a keyboard in half. 

I borrowed a hacksaw and sandpaper from @javier, picked out some screwdrivers from the company's toolbox, and disassembled a keyboard.

The internals of keyboards are simple. There are two paper-thin plastic sheets with circuits embedded within. When two metal contacts from different sheets touch, it means a key is presed. Each key on your keyboard has a rubbery dome covering a little pin, which when pressed, causes the two sheets to contact at that point.

I guessed that I shouldn't mess with the circuits, so I left the plastic sheets and sawed the hard plastic enclosure in half, then placed a sheet of paper between the exposed half. Sometimes keys became unresponsive. I first tried with a wired keyboard, which worked beautifully. A while later, I tried two wireless keyboards. They never worked quite as well, because I had to deal with battery placement.

Using two keyboards was initially awkward, but quickly became just as comfortable as using one. A caveat is that it would slow you down if you're not a touch-typist. Occassionally I miss keys without looking like "]" or "&", so if I'm looking at the keyboard, it's only ever the right-hand one.

## Gauntlets

My grander vision was to be able to walk around typing. I acted to achieve this with keyboard gauntlets. I bought two cheap wireless keybaords (£10 each), and thought about how to attach them to my hands. I experimented with my one cut-in-half keyboard, tried strapping it to my hand, but that blatantly obstructed typing. I Googled and Amazoned for gauntlets, but found nothing that made sense. I went to a large Decathalon sports store to spark some creativity. 

I roamed the aisles searching and considering: boxing gloves, while an obvious choice, were expensive and not suited for purpose. All sorts of other golves - riding, golfing, skiing, cycling, lifting - weren't appropriate either. Splinting a badminton racquet to each arm was the best solution I could see so far... Then I walked past the swimming section. Flippers, while made for feet, were exactly what I was looking for. They were gauntlet-like and had a platform upon which a keyboard could be placed. I spent the next 20 minutes in the store sticking my hand in children-sized flippers, imagining the right size and orientation for forearm and considering how I would cut holes in them. I found a suitable size EU 5 pair for £5.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I began slowly constructing the gauntlets. Step one was to cut up the flipper to trail it on my single halved keyboard (wired). I cut off the rubbery end and cut a hole in the bottom, so my forearm could fit through. It needed something to hold it --- It needed another point of contact to hold it against my arm, so I threaded a shoestring through the rubber. It was also rather abrasive in the parts where I hacksawed through rough plastic, so I covered those parts with pieces of old shoe and electrical tape.


## Mounted keyboards

The gauntlets were good in that they were mobile, but traditional keyboards can't be fixed to your your wrists/forearms. Another inspiration I had was to Dr. Octopus my keyboards. <insert dr octopus keyboard pic> That would make them mobile and usable. Having experienced the high difficulty of making keyboards wearable, I made the compromise of Dr. Octopusing my desk instead. I bought two large wired keyboards <amazon link> and a set of flexible arm tablet holders <amazon link>. I quickly found that I needed two tablet holders per keyboard, and that it was difficult to get the keyboards in a comfortable orientation: once the keyboards + tablet holders were in place, they couldn't be moved. It was ok, though, since the convenience of the keyboard setup always working was worth the reduction in mobility. I speared squishy balls onto the setup for palm rests. 

The balance board combines nicely with the palm rests and extending keyboards, so that you can subtly balance yourself when needed. The keyboards can move slightly if you press much too hard, but the setup is strong enough for reasonable use. The palm rests are incredibly useful to find hand placement on keyboards, since they're larger tactile locators than the bumps in the "f" and "j" keys.

The setup is great for pair-programming, but pairers sometimes find the large screen to be too far away. I've only once had another developer plug in their keyboard to the setup to pair-program, so it's amenable to that kind of thing, but not really a part of our company's pair-programming culture. Unfortunately, the setup is not usable by other. It's rather intimidating, and would take a few days to get used to two keyboards + standing + wobble board. It's adapted to my height and preferred arm positioning, so it's immediately uncomfortable to anyone not ~6'1"-6'5".

As a tech lead, much of my day is spent near my desk, but about half is interacting with other developers, stakeholders, etc. That means I don't need to be standing at my computer all the time. When my attention isn't on my computer, I take a seat to talk or ponder. That said, when it's a quiet (individually productive) day, standing for more than an hour at a time is uncomfortable.

## Sitting/Standing alternative

When I alternated between sitting in a chair and standing, I would inevitably begin to spend all my time sitting. A good solution was to not have a chair, but to use nearby couches after standing too long. This also wasn't a perfect solution because my couch-sitting posture is bad and only having a small laptop monitor isn't ideal. My requirements were strange:

* About as comfortable as standing (not too much more or too much less)
* Good posture
* More than one screen (ideally)
* At my desk (ideally)

Around this time, I also bought an ironing board. @Manoj had one in his flat, and it was usable as a budget adjustable standing/sitting desk. My intentions were to attach my keyboards to it so that I could easily adjust the height of the keyboards. The edges of the ironing board were too flimsy and the tablet-holder clamps weren't versatile enough, so this wasn't possible, but the ironing board was still an adjustable-height desk.

I had also recently bought a stool for meditation. I was using it to meditate at lunchtime, but it turned out to be a great alternative to sitting in an office chair - about as comfortable as standing with decent posture. I adjusted the ironing board to a reasonable height and found a spare monitor. The standing mat made a great kneeling mat, and all I needed was a comfortable keyboard. @0aten very generously gave me the split keyboard that seeded my desk evolution, and I tore a plank from a standing desk and taped it to the ironing board.

This kneeling setup is great with a few caveats. Pair programming is not possible. The keyboard arms slightly block the view of a bit of the monitor.
