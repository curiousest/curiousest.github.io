A year ago aI went on vacation and realized I had significant tension and pain in my shoulders and bcack. The pain was entirely attributable to my posture at my computer working all day. I decided that I would fix it. So be gan my desk journey...

My first inspiration was seeing my scolleague @Oaten's split keyboard.

One of my intuitions was that I wants slouching in my chair. The other was that putting my hands together on a laptop keyboard was curving and tensing my upper back and shoulders.

@Oatens keyboard was split, resolving one of the two problems. I looked online for the keyboard and found that it was unreasonably priced - $80. I knew I could get two keyboards for about $10, after a bit more searching, so I did.

I first used the extra keyboard s lying around at work. I had one of my own, as well as one owned by a different colleague. The first problem I encountered was theat the re wasn't enough room on the standing desk for two keybaords anda laptop.

<Above> standing desk. I had tried using a standing desk on a few occassionas. I found that after standing for a while, I would alsways return to sitting. The padded mats helped quite a bit, but never completely solved the problem. During this period, I did spent most of my day at my sdesk programming aloen.

Problem: keybaords too big
==========================

The solution was to get a bigger desk or --. The solution was to make the keybaords smaller (I ignored all other possible solutions, like a bigger desk or more creative keyboard placement). Buying a smaller keyoboard wasn't really possible, so I decided to cut my keyboard in half. I borrowed a hacksaw and found out how keyboards work by trial and error.

The internals of keyboards are very simple. There are two plastic sheets with circuits embedded within - about papter-thin. TWhen the metal of the circuits contact between the two sheets, it means a key is presed. Each key on your keyboard has a rubbery dome which pushes a pin down when pressed, causing the two sheets to contact at the opint where the key is pressed.

My half-keyboard worked well, and I was able to use it with the other full keyboard productively. I had grander ideas , though. The two keyboards on the standing desk still wasn't especially comfortable - I had to half-kneel, hanlf stand at my standing desk. People made meemes about me being a flamingo. I required a pillow to kneel on, on top of my desk.

My grand vision was to be able to walk around typing. This would be achieved with keyboard gauntlets. I bought two cheap wireless keybaords ($10)each) . and beginan to think about how to attach them to my hands. I tried strapping them to my hands, but ..---m I experimented with my one cut-in-half keyboard, tried strapping it to my hand, but the obstructed my typing ability. I googled and amazoned for gauntlets, but nothing came up that made sense. I descided to go to a large Decathalon sports store to spark some creativity. I roamed the aisles for a while - boxing gloves, while an obvious choice , were expensive and not suited for purpose. All sorts of other golves - riding, glofing, skiing, scycling, etc weren't appropriate either. Attaching ba-- Splinting a badminton rachqet to each arm was the best solution I could see so far... Then I walked past the switmming section. Flippers were exactly what I was looking for. They were glove-like and had a playform for attaching the keyboard. I spent the next 20 minutes in the store sticking children's my hand in children's flippers, trying to imagine what the right size would be for my forearm and imagining cutting holes in them, etc. I found a suitable pair and bought them.

Around this time, another colleague, @Manoj, came up with a genius itea. He was also using a standig desk, and he bought a balance board to keep him moving while standing. I immediately copied him and iterated, adding the standing mat on top of it. After digging a small hold int he wooden floor, mgmt asked m ye to iterate again, and I put a n old shoe underneath.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I slowly began constructing my gauntlets. Step one was to cut up the flipper to trail it on my single halved keyboard (wired). I cut off the rubbery end and cut a hole in the bottom, so my forearm could fit through. It needed something to hold it --- It needed another point of contact to hold it against my arm, so I threaded a shoestring through the rubber. It was also rather abrasive in the parts where I hacksawed through rough plastic, so I covered those parts with pieces of old shoe and electrical tape.
