WORK IN PROGRESS

A year ago I went on vacation and realized I had significant tension and pain in my shoulders and back. The pain was entirely attributable to my posture programming at my desk all day. In particular, tensing forward/inward tightening my chest muscles as well as slouched-forward posture curving my back and neck. I decided that I would fix it. <sloched pic> <chest muscles pic>

## Standing desk

A standing desk fixed my slouched-forward posture. I had tried a standing desk before (along with everyone else in the office). Another colleague, @Manoj, had a genius idea. He was using a standing desk, but he bought a balance board to keep him moving while standing. I immediately copied him and iterated, adding the standing mat on top of it. After digging a small hold in the wooden floor, management asked me to iterate again, and I put an old shoe underneath.

My keyboard on the standing desk still wasn't especially comfortable - I had to half-kneel, half-stand at my standing desk to be able to stand all day. People made memes.

## Two keyboards

My first inspiration for fixing my tensing forward/inward was seeing my scolleague @Oaten's split keyboard.

One of my intuitions was that I wants slouching in my chair. The other was that putting my hands together on a laptop keyboard was curving and tensing my upper back and shoulders.

@Oatens keyboard was split, resolving one of the two problems. I looked online for the keyboard and found that it was unreasonably priced - $80. I knew I could get two keyboards for about $10, after a bit more searching, so I did.

I first used the extra keyboard s lying around at work. I had one of my own, as well as one owned by a different colleague. The first problem I encountered was theat the re wasn't enough room on the standing desk for two keybaords anda laptop.

<Above> standing desk. I had tried using a standing desk on a few occassionas. I found that after standing for a while, I would alsways return to sitting. The padded mats helped quite a bit, but never completely solved the problem. During this period, I did spent most of my day at my sdesk programming aloen.

A problem was that the keyboards were too big for the standing desk. The solution was to get a bigger desk or --. The solution was to make the keybaords smaller (I ignored all other possible solutions, like a bigger desk or more creative keyboard placement). Buying a smaller keyoboard wasn't really possible, so I decided to cut my keyboard in half. I borrowed a hacksaw and found out how keyboards work by trial and error.

The internals of keyboards are very simple. There are two plastic sheets with circuits embedded within - about papter-thin. TWhen the metal of the circuits contact between the two sheets, it means a key is presed. Each key on your keyboard has a rubbery dome which pushes a pin down when pressed, causing the two sheets to contact at the opint where the key is pressed.

Using two keyboards is initially awkward, but quickly becomes just as comfortable as using one. A caveat is that you must be mostly a touch-typist. Occassionally I miss keys without looking like "]" or "&", so if I'm looking at the keyboard, it's only ever the right-hand one.

## Gauntlets

My grand vision was to be able to walk around typing. This would be achieved with keyboard gauntlets. I bought two cheap wireless keybaords ($10)each) . and beginan to think about how to attach them to my hands. I tried strapping them to my hands, but ..---m I experimented with my one cut-in-half keyboard, tried strapping it to my hand, but the obstructed my typing ability. I googled and amazoned for gauntlets, but nothing came up that made sense. I descided to go to a large Decathalon sports store to spark some creativity. I roamed the aisles for a while - boxing gloves, while an obvious choice , were expensive and not suited for purpose. All sorts of other golves - riding, glofing, skiing, scycling, etc weren't appropriate either. Attaching ba-- Splinting a badminton rachqet to each arm was the best solution I could see so far... Then I walked past the switmming section. Flippers were exactly what I was looking for. They were glove-like and had a playform for attaching the keyboard. I spent the next 20 minutes in the store sticking children's my hand in children's flippers, trying to imagine what the right size would be for my forearm and imagining cutting holes in them, etc. I found a suitable pair and bought them.


Over the course of the next few weeks, I slowly began constructing my gauntlets. Step one was to cut up the flipper to trail it on my single halved keyboard (wired). I cut off the rubbery end and cut a hole in the bottom, so my forearm could fit through. It needed something to hold it --- It needed another point of contact to hold it against my arm, so I threaded a shoestring through the rubber. It was also rather abrasive in the parts where I hacksawed through rough plastic, so I covered those parts with pieces of old shoe and electrical tape.


## Mounted keyboards

The gauntlets were good in that they were mobile, but traditional keyboards can't be fixed to your your wrists/forearms. Another inspiration I had was to Dr. Octopus my keyboards. <insert dr octopus keyboard pic> That would make them mobile and usable. Having experienced the high difficulty of making keyboards wearable, I made the compromise of Dr. Octopusing my desk instead. I bought two large wired keyboards <amazon link> and a set of flexible arm tablet holders <amazon link>. I quickly found that I needed two tablet holders per keyboard, and that it was difficult to get the keyboards in a comfortable orientation: once the keyboards + tablet holders were in place, they couldn't be moved. It was ok, though, since the convenience of the keyboard setup always working was worth the reduction in mobility. I speared squishy balls onto the setup for palm rests. 

The balance board combines nicely with the palm rests and extending keyboards, so that you can subtly balance yourself when needed. The keyboards can move slightly if you press much too hard, but the setup is strong enough for reasonable use. The palm rests are incredibly useful to find hand placement on keyboards, since they're larger tactile locators than the bumps in the "f" and "j" keys.

The setup is great for pair-programming, but pairers sometimes find the large screen to be too far away. I've only once had another developer plug in their keyboard to the setup to pair-program, so it's amenable to that kind of thing, but not really a part of our company's pair-programming culture. Unfortunately, the setup is not usable by other. It's rather intimidating, and would take a few days to get used to two keyboards + standing + wobble board. It's adapted to my height and preferred arm positioning, so it's immediately uncomfortable to anyone not ~6'1"-6'5".

As a tech lead, much of my day is spent near my desk, but about half is interacting with other developers, stakeholders, etc. That means I don't need to be standing at my computer all the time. When my attention isn't on my computer, I take a seat to talk or ponder. That said, when it's a quiet (individually productive) day, standing for more than an hour at a time is uncomfortable.

## Sitting/Standing alternative

When I alternated between sitting in a chair and standing, I would inevitably begin to spend all my time sitting. A good solution was to not have a chair, but to use nearby couches after standing too long. This also wasn't a perfect solution because my couch-sitting posture is bad and only having a small laptop monitor isn't ideal. My requirements were strange:

* About as comfortable as standing (not too much more or too much less)
* Good posture
* More than one screen (ideally)
* At my desk (ideally)

Around this time, I also bought an ironing board. @Manoj had one in his flat, and it was usable as a budget adjustable standing/sitting desk. My intentions were to attach my keyboards to it so that I could easily adjust the height of the keyboards. The edges of the ironing board were too flimsy and the tablet-holder clamps weren't versatile enough, so this wasn't possible, but the ironing board was still an adjustable-height desk.

I had also recently bought a stool for meditation. I was using it to meditate at lunchtime, but it turned out to be a great alternative to sitting in an office chair - about as comfortable as standing with decent posture. I adjusted the ironing board to a reasonable height and found a spare monitor. The standing mat made a great kneeling mat, and all I needed was a comfortable keyboard. @0aten very generously gave me the split keyboard that seeded my desk evolution, and I tore a plank from a standing desk and taped it to the ironing board.

This kneeling setup is great with a few caveats. Pair programming is not possible. The keyboard arms slightly block the view of a bit of the monitor.
