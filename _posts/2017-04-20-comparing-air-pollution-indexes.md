There are a lot of air pollution indexes. (There are 10 in [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index) as of April 2017) There is such a variety because:

* There are many different particles that contribute to air pollution.
  * Different particles are relevant for different areas of the world.
  * Some particles are relevant everywhere.
* Different countries want to give different recommendations.
  * Ex: If your pollution index says every reading above 100 is "very bad", but many places in your country consistently have readings ranging from 100 to 900, your pollution index will not be useful to your constituents. You need different kinds of "very bad".
