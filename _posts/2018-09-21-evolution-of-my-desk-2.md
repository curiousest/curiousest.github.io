WORK IN PROGRESS

I work in an open office. Open offices are loud and distracting. I attempted to build a solution.

I started with this

I tried doing this:

I ended up with this

## The problem

* Hearing people talking
* Seeing activity in field of vision

Open offices are loud - for your ears and your eyes. Discussions, pair programming, and X around your desk produce both volume and attention-grabbing motion near your field of vision. While those distractions may be small and easy to ignore, they leech willpower and focus over time.

Headphones alone aren't enough to drown out people talking. Personally, I'm not willing to constantly play music loud enough to drown out > 2 discussions in a volume competition. 

## Proposed solution

There's a lot of material on soundproofing. The material is focused on how to soundproof a room or plug your ears. There is little material on how to sound-proof your head.

Soundproofing options:

* Reflect and absorb incoming sound waves
* Dampen sound waves that have made their way into the enclosure (absorb and prevent reverberation)
* Cancel sound (active antinoise sound generators)
* Increase distance between source and receiver

### How to plug your ears

Types of earplugs:

These suck. Foam earplugs and all types of apple earbuds have always fallen out for me:
<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Disposable_foam_earplugs.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

These were interesting, but not great. For me, they were a slight improvement over foam earplugs:

There are earplugs that reduce the intensity of sound without changing it much (hi-fi earplugs). I've never tried any before:

These are my favourite:

<picture of custom molded earplugs>

Most earbuds don't fit my ears and most earplugs don't work for me. These fit perfectly, since they are moulded to my ear. They both reduce the intensity of sound and change sound.

Even if your ears are perfectly soundproofed, you will be able to hear via bone conduction - bone is used as the medium to transmit sound waves to your eardrums.

### How to soundproof a room (the size of your head)

https://www.explainthatstuff.com/soundproofing.html

1. Reduce unsealed airpaths

Most noise will come through sound's path of least resistance, then it will bounce around inside the enclosure. That path of least resistance is most likely going to be air - whether it's a window, gaps around doors, or an open neckline for the box on your head.

2. Improve mediums of least resistance

Commonly used transparent materials don't seem to have high noise reduction coefficients [citation needed]. To improve any barrier, you can add multiple layers or make them thicker.

Materials with high noise reduction coefficients seem to mostly be very heavy [citation needed] - a major problem for headwear. 

3. Absorb sound inside enclosure

4. Cancel sound

### Real-life design constraints

1. Weight: things that are good at blocking sound are also heavy [citation needed]. Heavy things on your head are very uncomfortable.
2. Air: restricting air movement around your head affects breathing and makes enclosures hot + stuffy
3. Time to set up: like I learned in my previous experiment, impediments to start doing work (inertia) are highly undesirable.

### Thought experiment: container on head

1. Existing design project: Helmfon

This is what you may find if you look around for avante-garde office soundproofing. Generic headphones with horse-blinders would be more effective at achieving the same functional purpose. It's probably useless because:

* It's completely unsealed
* If the material is a good sound barrier (dense), it will be uncomfortably heavy

2. Deadmau5 head

Source: https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-your-own-Deadmau5-mouse-head-helmet/

This is probably a good idea.

DIY instructions: https://www.google.com/search?q=DIY+deadmau5+helmet

Especially if the eyes are closed off with a transparent material and mouth hole is closed off with breathable material. I strongly considered building this, but:

* I couldn't find a head-sized sphere to conveniently buy at a reasonable price in UK
* DIY spheres are flimsy (paper-mache + chicken wire)
* It is difficult to reinforce a sphere (you have to paste rectangles on a sphere)

3. Pyramid head

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8oRtaoQYsVY/maxresdefault.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

Boxes don't comfortably balance on your head, especially heavy ones. Changing the orientation of boxes to rest diamond-like, point-up distributes the weight on the shoulders and sides of your head.

### Thought experiment: existing helmets

1. Diving helmet

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lb9CWDr.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

This is probably a decent sound barrier, but very expensive and heavy relative to the sound-blocking it provides.

2. Motorcycle helmet

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/White_full-face-helmet.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

Much of the sound-reduction from motorcycle helmets come from aerodynamics (not generating noise in the first place). Still, they are:

* Made of sound-blocking materials
* Equipped with sound-cancelling
* Light enough to rest comfortably on your head
* Close to air-tight

### Thought experiment: hanging container

Regardless of which container-on-head option is chosen, it's likely to be too heavy to support without assistance.

## Building the solution

Can't find a reasonably-priced sphere.

Can't get a sound-proof box

I bought this acrylic box on Amazon (£30) and acoustic sealant (~£2) to glue things together while soundproofing the cracks/joints/gaps between the things being glued together.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6vq80zJ.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I bought acoustic barrier, used to sound-proof cars.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jZNocWm.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I cut it up and cleaned it
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e4kxtWj.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I glued everything together

Glue closeup: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xy1QJBl.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I put it on my head

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6vq80zJ.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WG1kBPN.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

It sucked + was impractical.
* Flimsy (I could feel the edges & corners of the box flexing too much)
* Very heavy and uncomfortable
* Didn't block sound very well (exposed neckline, acrylic face area not a great barrier)

To finish it off, I was going to add flaps to seal the neck/shoulder area,

 but it wasn't working well as it existed already, so I trashed the idea.

## Conclusion

I got bose headphones + earplugs. They're amazing
