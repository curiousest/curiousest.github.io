WORK IN PROGRESS

I work in an open office. Open offices are loud and distracting. I attempted to solve this problem with a second iteration on my desk <link to first iteration>.

I started with this
<picture of black headphones with earplugs>

I tried doing this
<picture of box on head>

I ended up with this
<picture of bose with earplugs>


## The problem

* Hearing people talking
* Seeing activity in field of vision

Open offices are loud - for your ears and your eyes. Discussions, pair programming, and X around your desk produce both volume and attention-grabbing motion near your field of vision. While those distractions may be small and easy to ignore, they leech willpower and focus over time.

Headphones alone aren't enough to drown out people talking. Personally, I'm not willing to constantly play music loud enough to drown out > 2 discussions in a volume competition. 

## Proposed solution

Scuba diving helmet

...

Picture of cone thing

...

Motorcycle helmet

...

Sound blocking

...

Sealing

...

Deadmau5 head

...

Hair fuzzing machines hanging from lamp pole

...

Sound-proof box <pyramid head>


## Building the solution

Can't get a sound-proof box

Stuff is heavy

Air carries sound

How to block sound (reflect + absorb, water analogy)

Blocking air movement is also hot+stuffy

Clear box with parts covered

Car sound-proofing

Soundproof glue

Emergent abstract art

It sucked + was impractical

## Conclusion

I got bose headphones 1/4 of the way through the project. They're amazing
