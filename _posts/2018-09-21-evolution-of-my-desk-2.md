I work in an open office. Open offices are loud and distracting. I attempted to build a solution. [Part 1](/2017/06/13/evolution-of-my-desk.html)

I started with this:<br/>

I ended up with this:<br/>

## The problem

* Hearing people talking
* Seeing activity in field of vision

Open offices are loud - for your ears and your eyes. Discussions, pair programming, and X around your desk produce attention-grabbing sound and motion. While each individual distraction may be small and easy to ignore, they collectively leech willpower, focus, and productivity over time.

Headphones alone aren't enough to drown out people talking. Personally, I'm not willing to constantly play music loud enough to drown out 2+ volume-competing conversations. 

## Proposed solution

There's a lot of material on soundproofing. The material is focused on how to soundproof a room or plug your ears. There is little material on how to sound-proof your head.

Soundproofing options:

* Reflect and absorb incoming sound waves
* Dampen sound waves that have made their way into the enclosure (absorb and prevent reverberation)
* Cancel sound (active antinoise sound generators)
* Increase distance between source and receiver

## Sound context

### How to plug your ears

Types of earplugs:

**Foam earplugs.** These suck. My ear canal is not suited for this type of earplug - foam earplugs and all types of apple earbuds have always fallen out for me. (~$1):

**Metal earplugs with foam inserts.** These were interesting, but not great. For me, they were a slight improvement over foam earplugs (~$30):

**Hi-fi earplugs.** There are earplugs that reduce the intensity of sound without changing it much. I've never tried any before. (~$50):

**Moulded earplugs** These are my favourite. They are very good at blocking sound, but they muffle/distort sound heavily. (~$10):

Even if your ears are perfectly soundproofed, you will be able to hear via bone conduction - bone is used as the medium to transmit sound waves to your eardrums.

### How to soundproof a room (the size of your head)

#### Reduce unsealed airpaths

Most noise will come through sound's path of least resistance, then it will bounce around inside the enclosure. That path of least resistance is most likely going to be air - whether it's a window, gaps around doors, or an open neckline under the box on your head.

#### Improve mediums of least resistance

Commonly used transparent materials don't seem to have high noise reduction coefficients [citation needed]. To improve any barrier, you can add multiple layers or make them thicker. The human body has a high noise reduction coeffieicent - this significantly reduces the complexity of sound-proofing your head.

Materials with high noise reduction coefficients seem to mostly be very heavy [citation needed] - a major problem for headwear. 

#### Absorb sound inside enclosure

#### Cancel sound

### Real-life design constraints

1. Weight: things that are good at blocking sound are also heavy [citation needed]. Heavy things on your head are very uncomfortable.
2. Air: restricting air movement around your head affects breathing and makes enclosures hot + stuffy
3. Time to set up: like I learned in my previous experiment, impediments to start doing work (inertia) are highly undesirable.

## Thought experiments before building

### Thought experiment: container on head

#### Existing design project: [Helmfon](http://hochurayu.com/product_design/helmfon/)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sV9GYUc.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

This is what you may find if you look around for avante-garde office soundproofing. Generic headphones with horse-blinders would be more effective at achieving the same functional purpose. It's probably useless because:

* It's completely unsealed
* If the material is a good sound barrier (dense), Helmfon would be uncomfortably heavy. It's probably not (the project is design over function), so the helmet part of Helmfon probably wouldn't be very effective.

#### Sphere on head

[Source.](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-build-your-own-Deadmau5-mouse-head-helmet/) [Other DIY instructions.](https://www.google.com/search?q=DIY+deadmau5+helmet)
This is probably a good idea.

This could work particularly well if the eyes are closed off with a transparent material and mouth hole is closed off with breathable material. I strongly considered building this, but:

* I couldn't find a head-sized sphere to conveniently buy at a reasonable price in UK
* DIY spheres are flimsy (paper-mache + chicken wire)
* It is difficult to reinforce a sphere (you have to paste rectangles on a sphere)

#### Box on head

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8oRtaoQYsVY/maxresdefault.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

Boxes don't comfortably balance on your head, especially heavy ones. Changing the orientation of boxes to rest diamond-like, point-up distributes the weight on the shoulders and sides of your head. Boxes are convenient to buy and reasonably-priced.

### Thought experiment: repurpose existing helmets

#### Diving helmet

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lb9CWDr.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

This is probably a decent sound barrier, but very expensive and heavy relative to the sound-blocking it provides.

#### Motorcycle helmet

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/White_full-face-helmet.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

Much of the sound-reduction from motorcycle helmets come from aerodynamics (not generating noise in the first place). Still, they are:

* Made of sound-blocking materials
* Equipped with sound-cancelling
* Light enough to rest comfortably on your head
* Close to air-tight

### Thought experiment: hanging container

Regardless of which container-on-head option is chosen, it's likely to be too heavy to support without assistance.

## Building the solution

### Sound-proof head container

I bought an acrylic box on Amazon (£30) and acoustic sealant (~£2) to glue things together while soundproofing the cracks/joints/gaps between the things being glued together.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6vq80zJ.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I bought acoustic barrier, usually used to sound-proof cars.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jZNocWm.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I cut up the acoustic barrier and washed it.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e4kxtWj.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I glued everything together.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xy1QJBl.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

I put it on my head.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WG1kBPN.jpg" style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 800px; width: auto; height: auto;"><br/>

It sucked.

* Flimsy (I could feel the edges & corners of the box flexing too much)
* Very heavy and uncomfortable
* Didn't block sound very well (exposed neckline, acrylic face area not a great barrier)

To finish it off, I was going to add flaps to seal the neck/shoulder area, but it wasn't working well as it existed already, so I trashed the idea.
