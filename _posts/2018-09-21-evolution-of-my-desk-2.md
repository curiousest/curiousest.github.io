WORK IN PROGRESS

I work in an open office. Open offices are loud and distracting. I attempted to solve this problem with a second iteration on my desk <link to first iteration>.

I started with this

I tried doing this

I ended up with this

## The problem

* Hearing people talking
* Seeing activity in field of vision

Open offices are loud - for your ears and your eyes. Discussions, pair programming, and X around your desk produce both volume and attention-grabbing motion near your field of vision. While those distractions may be small and easy to ignore, they leech willpower and focus over time.

Headphones alone aren't enough to drown out people talking. Personally, I'm not willing to constantly play music loud enough to drown out > 2 discussions in a volume competition. 

## Proposed solution

There's a lot of material on soundproofing. The vast majority is focused on how to soundproof a room or plug your ears.

Soundproofing options:

* Reflect and absorb incoming sound waves
* Dampen sound waves that have made their way into the enclosure (absorb and prevent reverberation)
* Cancel sound (active antinoise sound generators)
* Increase distance between source and receiver

### How to plug your ears

Types of earplugs:

These suck:

These were interesting, but not great:

There are earplugs that reduce the intensity of sound without changing it much:

These are my favourite:

Most earbuds don't fit my ears and most earplugs don't work for me. These fit perfectly, since they are moulded to my ear. They both reduce the intensity of sound and change sound.

Even if your ears are perfectly soundproofed, you will be able to hear via bone conduction - bone is used as the medium to transmit sound waves to your eardrums.

### How to soundproof a room (the size of your head)

### Thought experiment 1

Scuba diving helmet

...

Picture of cone thing

...

Deadmau5 head

...

Sound-proof box <pyramid head>

...

### Thought experiment 2


Hair fuzzing machines hanging from lamp pole

...

### Thought experiment 3

Motorcycle helmet

...

## Building the solution

Can't get a sound-proof box

Stuff is heavy

Air carries sound

How to block sound (reflect + absorb, water analogy)

Blocking air movement is also hot+stuffy

Clear box with parts covered

Car sound-proofing

Soundproof glue

Emergent abstract art

It sucked + was impractical

## Conclusion

I got bose headphones 1/4 of the way through the project. They're amazing
