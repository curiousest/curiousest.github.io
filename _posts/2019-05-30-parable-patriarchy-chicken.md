I have a friend who is small. One evening walking on busy streets, I noticed that people kept bumping into her like she was a toy boat in rapids, smashing into rocks.

“You seem to be getting really unlucky - everyone is running into you.”

“No, this is normal for me.”

“Really!? I didn’t even know that was a thing.”

“You’re big and intimidating so no one will even come near you. Even if they see me, I’m hardly worth the effort to avoid.”

The End.

I think this beautifully illustrates privilege - the cruelty of people/systems/society and the obliviousness to others’ routine experiences. It applies to most of the *isms.
