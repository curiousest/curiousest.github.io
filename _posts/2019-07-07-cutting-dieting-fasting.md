# Cutting, dieting

I had been bulking for the last 8 months and achieved my second-heaviest mass and bodyfat percentage: about 91.5kg and ~20% bodyfat. I read a fitness article that explained how it can be preferrable to bulk and cut in the 5%-15% bodyfat range because your body will look better in that range. It convinced me, and I decided to begin intentionally "cutting" for the first time in my life.

# 24-hour fast

I have never experimented with fasting before (outside of the intermittent fasting schedule imposed by Vipassana meditation camps). I thought it would be interesting to try out a 24-hour fast. My goals were:

* To explore what extended fasting feels like and how it differs from an extended caloric defecit.
* To evaluate what a 48-72 hour fast would be like.

## Setup

I fasted from 8am Saturday to 8am Sunday. On Saturday, I had a ~1.25x bigger breakfast than my "cutting breakfast". I went to a 1pm HIIT kickboxing class at (Flykick)[https://flykick.co.uk/], and otherwise had a relatively sedentary day. I experienced many negative side-effects:

* Extreme irritability
* Physical weakness and feelings of fragility
* Frequent dizzyness and head rushes
* General physical discomfort

Surprisingly, I experienced very little of some other, expected negative side-effects:

* Hunger (aching or craving)
* Nausea
* Lack of concentration

The positive side-effects were:

* 81.1kg -> 80.0kg
* Increased ability to focus
* Spiritual feelings-inducing light-headedness

The conclusions I made were that I would fast for 24+ hours again to induce spiritual awareness or experiences. I would not fast for weight loss or productivity gains. I was too irritable to have normal interactions with other people. I was too weak and uncomfortable to be productive.
