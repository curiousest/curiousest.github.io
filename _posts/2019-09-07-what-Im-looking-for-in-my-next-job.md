# Purpose

When actively looking for a new position, I like my goals to be clear to me and available to others. This post documents the goals in my transitions. Like most goals/values lists, what's excluded is often as notable as what's included.

# 2019

I want to leverage my experience and concentrate on the [activites I like](/2019/09/07/activities-guiding-my-professional-career.html) so that I consistently am a high performer and enjoy the work I do.

## What I value

- Continuous personal improvement
- Highly collaborative environments (and highly collaborative, bottom-up decision-making)
- Radical transparency

## My 10-year goals:

* I want to coach companies/departments/teams and mentor founders/executives/architects/principal devs (senior management and individual contributors)
* I want to understand everything about how successful tech companies work by diving deep into them
* I want to live concurrently in China and Europe
* I want to be expressing what I've learned in a highly scalable way (writing posts/books/software)

## My 5-year goals:

The experience I gain in the next few years should enable me to achieve my 10+ year goals. These goals are unlikely to be achieved by staying in the same role/level - they require sustained growth.

* I want to influence a larger organization as a senior individual contributor
* I want more experience in senior/executive management
* I want to learn from people who are "top 10 in Europe at what they do" via recurring professional interaction

# 2017

## What I'm looking for in my next position

In 5-10 years, my goal is to be a CTO of a small/medium company or tech VP in a medium/large company - because I would enjoy it and be good at it. I'm interested in learning the soft and technical skills necessary for that role. 

In my next position, my title could be:

* Senior developer
* Machine learning / data engineer
* Engineering manager
* VP Eng
* CTO

## Skills I want to use/develop

Things I'm very interested in and actively studying:

* Back-end / server-side development and architecture 
* Machine learning and data engineering
* Line management / team structure
* Project management

Things I like to be competent at and sometimes study/explore:

* Dev-ops
* Frontend

Things I'm not as good at and not interested in investing significant effort learning (I can do these things in an early stage "everyone does everything" startup):

* Product owner & product strategy
* UX Design

## The kind of company I want to work at

* I want to work at a growing company, doing at least 60% software development - preferably 75%-90%, especially at the beginning. 
* I expect my peers and superiors to be exceptional and happy in their positions. 
* I want opportunities to grow my professional network of great relationships with great people. 
* I want to work with modern technologies.
* A bonus would be companies involved in sleep or air pollution tech, or companies that do business in China or have a significant Chinese user base.
