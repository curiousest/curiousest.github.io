# Purpose

When looking for a new position, I like my goals to be clear to me and available to others. This post documents the goals in my transitions. Like most goals/values lists, what's excluded is often as notable as what's included. At each transition, I have many "wants", but I don't expect to get them all - they're notable factors for my decision-making.

# 2025

Responsibility, founder-fit, and AI.

- Target role: IC in AI startup that augments experts, high return-on-hustle.
- Prefer seed-to-series-A, open to later stages with more scope.
- Prefer hybrid. I'm open to fully remote but I've seen more underperforming than high-performing ones.
- Also good at (best mixed with IC): product, line management, B2B customer-facing.
- Will stretch boundaries for literature/publishing.

# 2024

Growth, community, and AI.

Early stage company, as an IC that can grow either into management or sales/product-oriented roles. I want early stage to have the camaraderie and also to get involved in the industry.
# 2022

I'm not actively looking, just projecting that I will want some sort of change by this point in time (either within my current company or to a new one).

Two distant-future niches I want to pursue are:
- Automating expert tasks with AI
- Bridging Chinese<>Western AI tools and practices

For my long-term career goals, I am missing:
- experience with management responsibilities for an org (as opposed to "just being a people manager" - long-horizon choices, budget, exposure to investors/board, etc)
- world-class expertise in a domain
- business experience/network in China

I want to continue:
- living in London (and/or maybe the Sinosphere)
- working mostly remotely

To be more effective in companies that "automate expert tasks with AI", I need:
1. expert-level MLOps experience.
2. intermediate-level data science experience.
3. more business development / solution architecture experience.
4. more product management experience.

# 2019

I want to leverage my experience and concentrate on the [activities I like](/2019/09/07/activities-guiding-my-professional-career.html) so that I consistently am a high performer and enjoy the work I do.

## What I value

- Continuous personal improvement
- Highly collaborative environments (and highly collaborative, bottom-up decision-making)
- Radical transparency

## My 10-year goals:

* I want to coach companies/departments/teams and mentor founders/executives/architects/principal devs (senior management and individual contributors)
* I want to understand everything about how successful tech companies work by diving deep into them
* I want to live concurrently in China and Europe
* I want to be expressing what I've learned in a highly scalable way (writing posts/books/software)

## My 5-year goals:

The experience I gain in the next few years should enable me to achieve my 10+ year goals. These goals are unlikely to be achieved by staying in the same role/level - they require sustained growth.

* I want to influence a larger organization as a senior individual contributor
* I want more experience in senior/executive management
* I want to learn from people who are "top 10 in Europe at what they do" via recurring professional interaction

# 2017

## What I'm looking for in my next position

In 5-10 years, my goal is to be a CTO of a small/medium company or tech VP in a medium/large company - because I would enjoy it and be good at it. I'm interested in learning the soft and technical skills necessary for that role. 

In my next position, my title could be:

* Senior developer
* Machine learning / data engineer
* Engineering manager
* VP Eng
* CTO

## Skills I want to use/develop

Things I'm very interested in and actively studying:

* Back-end / server-side development and architecture 
* Machine learning and data engineering
* Line management / team structure
* Project management

Things I like to be competent at and sometimes study/explore:

* Dev-ops
* Frontend

Things I'm not as good at and not interested in investing significant effort learning (I can do these things in an early stage "everyone does everything" startup):

* Product owner & product strategy
* UX Design

## The kind of company I want to work at

* I want to work at a growing company, doing at least 60% software development - preferably 75%-90%, especially at the beginning. 
* I expect my peers and superiors to be exceptional and happy in their positions. 
* I want opportunities to grow my professional network of great relationships with great people. 
* I want to work with modern technologies.
* A bonus would be companies involved in sleep or air pollution tech, or companies that do business in China or have a significant Chinese user base.
