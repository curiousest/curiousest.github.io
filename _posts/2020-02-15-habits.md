I can't trust myself. What I want now doesn't help me achieve my goals in life, but my short-term wants are so, so powerful.

>I don't want to work out and cook, I just want to binge TV and junk food.<br/>
>I don't want to organize a meetup, I just want to play video games.<br/>
>I don't want to meditate, I just want to scroll through Reddit and Instagram.

So I do the "bad" things sometimes, then I do them some more.
<br/>Until the "bad" things become routine and the "good" things? A dream...

Habits are guide rails. They take over in the moment, leading me down a well-worn path. They could be "good" paths or "bad" paths - it's all relative to my goals. Once I [figure out my goals](/goals), the desired habits materialize. And with effort, I can shape my habits to lead me to where I want to be.


## 80% of habits

To establish a habit, I have to repeat its `trigger` > `craving` > `routine` > `reward`.

If my goal is to become more mindful, a bad habit is *consuming social media*.
* **`Trigger`**: a moment of boredom when my phone is on hand.
* **`Craving`**: want to feel entertained, not bored.
* **`Routine`**: open social media app and scroll through content.
* **`Reward`**: a small burst of entertainment.

 I *always* want to be working on my habits, good or bad. There's never been a week where I thought, "every decision I made this week was perfect." Practically, I invest in shaping `routines` and don't bother with the `trigger`, `craving`, or `reward`. I adjust in-the-moment costs and benefits - shepherding that neural net computation activated by feelings, context, and willpower inputs.

I make sure the easiest, default choices are good ones.

### Example stories: `Routine`

<details>
<summary>A good diet (click to expand)</summary>

I make convenient food the "correct" choice. I have a list of meals that take 5-15min of preparation and have consistent calories and protein. I make sure to always have ingredients available for them. The meal list and ingredient measurements are on one page fastened to my kitchen stove. It would take a lot of upfront effort to eat an off-diet meal.
<br/><br/>
I put effort into buying food at the right time. I schedule buying food far in advance, making sure never to run out and need fast alternatives. I buy food when I have willpower - when I'm not tired or hungry. Under these conditions, I pick good food and avoid bad food. I eat the food I have, and all the food I have is good.
<br/><br/>
I invested time and effort to put myself in this position.

<summary>Restricting media consumption</summary>

Sometimes I put extraordinary effort into sabotaging bad choices. I restrict media consumption because it doesn't bring me enough value for the time I spend on it:
<br/><br/>
I enable parental controls on my tablet and phone to blocklist websites, I change my computer's <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to blocklist domains, I log into my router to blocklist IPs. I get other people to choose the passwords I need to unlock all these things. On YouTube, I unfollow channels and block content creators that I deem unproductive. On Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter/Instagram, I unfollow friends and contacts until all newsfeed content is benign.
<br/><br/>
I still binge sometimes, taking down barriers. When I feel regret, I rebuild the walls. Then I erect stronger ones.

<summary>My workout routine</summary>

Working out is part of my day by default. I also treat it as the time to clear my head. I have regularly scheduled meetings on my calendar every day to work out. I make the inertia to working out as low as possible. In my last two offices, my gym was within five minutes of my desk. I also have a squat rack and weights in my bedroom as a backup.

<summary>Less addictive gaming</summary>

I could spend all my waking hours gaming. A big problem for me is that I find it especially hard to stop without completing something. Whether it's an hour-long multiplayer game or one act of many in a single-player game, it pains me to stop part-way through. That makes gaming take far more time, with far less flexibility. As silly as it sounds, I replaced playing video games with watching others play them on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. I got half the enjoyment but I lost the need to finish. I experienced a fraction of the addiction too.
<br/><br/>
I even found watching too addictive and time-consuming, but it was an important stepping stone to my gaming abstinence.

<summary>Higher highs or higher lows</summary>
A few months ago, I focused on maximizing peak productivity. My writing was 2x as productive for two weeks. Then I hit a low point and I didn't write at all for a three-month stretch. What's worth investing more in: 2x-ing peak productivity or maintaining a baseline when times get tough?

## Committing my identity

> *Three ways to change your habits:*
> 
> - *Option A:  Have an epiphany*
> - *Option B:  Change your environment*
> - *Option C:  Take baby steps*
> 
>*Creating an epiphany is difficult. So rule out Option A unless you have magical powers...*
>
>*-Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg*

I disagree.

The habits I care about started big and the first step was never a baby one. It was a change like, "Starting from today, my life is different. I'm *a weightlifter*."

Here is how I commit my identity:

>I see a lifestyle and I want it.
>
>If I covet the rewards, it will inspire me.
>
>If I find inspiration, I will research it.
>
>If I see an opportunity, I will try it.
>
>If I fail, I will know what to change.
>
>If I iterate, it will grow into part of me.
>
>If I identify with the habit, I will evangelize it.
>
>This is my life now. I am an ___.

I research possibilities and empathize with people who have shared their experiences. I brainstorm changes to how I live and visualize results. It's a passive mental activity - background processing for days or weeks. I may block out an hour to contemplate, thinking about it when I walk, shower, daydream...

At some point, *it clicks*. I know what to do. I choose the right time to begin - when I have high willpower and my life has few unknowns - and I commit to it. I try it, find out what doesn't work, fix that. Try again. Iterate. Persevere.

Week after week, I put time and effort into this habit, so it's on my mind. It creeps into conversation. I test the waters, a discussion flows into a debate with a friend who will suffer me. The debate brings me back to this planet, teaches me how others think about the costs and rewards of the habit. I take the side I'm invested in. And by now I'm oh-so invested - I've committed time, money, and social capital.

A few debates later, somewhere along my [escalation of commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment), I begin to identify with the habit. I truly identify with the habit when I evangelize it. With the experience I've gathered debating the habit, I can make it sound appealing. I can't help but evangelize.

### Examples

<details>
<summary>A good diet (click to expand)</summary>

"A <a href="https://curiousest.com/diet/">diet habit</a> will make me look better, feel better, look better, spend less time on food, look better..."
<br/><br/>
I contemplated the possibilities and implications until I found a path to commitment. I saw a dietician, followed their advice, and kept what worked. My diet became part of my identity. When someone talks about food, my perspective is, <i>as someone on a strict diet</i>.
<br/><br/>
Why doesn't everyone eat "correctly"? They probably don't have the awareness or tools, just like pre-diet me.
<br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Video game abstinence</summary>

"Not consuming video games will give me more productivity. More time for the things I wish I spent my time on."
<br/><br/>
I thought and thought until I found the path to commitment (or in this case, wall of commitment). Each time I over-indulged, I put barriers in front of the platform I binged on. I deleted games, hid devices, threw away passwords. I became a former gamer. Gaming is part of my identity and so is its abstinence. In conversations about video games, I get excited. When the conversation drifts to present gaming, I apologize for not being up-to-date but empathize with the passion. I'm <i>a former gamer</i>.
<br/><br/>
Although I enjoyed video games, they weren't bringing me long-term rewards. Are they the best time investment? What goals do they help you achieve? Surely you can find a form of entertainment that makes you better every day.
<br/>

## Conclusion

Most of my decisions happen in the moment where my short-term cravings pull me away from my long-term goals. Habits are a tool to guide my short-term decisions. I can change my habits, making the default choices "good". My most successful habits came from committing myself, changing my identity.

## Appendix

### Example stories: `Trigger`

<details>
<summary>Peer pressure (click to expand)</summary>

I have a friend who always tempts me with indulgent food. I shared my diet goals with them and the importance of these goals to me. I explained that I don't always have the willpower to resist, but resisting is always the right choice. I asked them to help me achieve my goals and not actively work against them.
<br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Restricting media consumption</summary>

I got into a bad habit of watching TV or scrolling through social media while eating. A very hard habit to break and a huge timesink. I tried mindful eating, with no distractions, but that never stuck. I bought print subscriptions to The Economist and Harvard Business Review. I leave the magazines where I eat. Now I consume a less addictive, less time-consuming media source while I eat.
<br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Habit tracking</summary>

I have a habit/gratitude/goal-tracking book, and I used to leave it beside my bed, but I often forgot. I moved it to my kitchen table where I eat in the morning and at night. I record after I eat breakfast and dinner.

<br/><br/>
“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”

“One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.”
<br/><br/>

“People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”
<br/><br/>

“Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.”

Their advice didn't suit me (explored in "Committing my identity").
<br/><br/>

<b>Choice quotes</b>
<br/><br/>

The essence of Tiny Habits is to take a behavior you want, make it tiny, find where it fits naturally in your life, and nurture its growth.
<br/><br/>

"The foundation of the Mini Habits system is in ‘stupid small’ steps."
<br/><br/>

"You can disrupt a behavior you don’t want by removing the prompt. This isn’t always easy, but removing the prompt is your best first move to stop a behavior from happening."
<br/><br/>

“We’re quick to blame ourselves for lack of progress, but slow to blame our strategies."

<b>Choice quotes</b>
<br/><br/>

"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things"
<br/><br/>

"If I really want to improve my situation, I can work on the one thing over which I have control - myself."
