WORK IN PROGRESS

I had an extreme diet and not the average extreme. Over the last few years, I ate the same thing for breakfast and lunch. More than half of my calories came from [one food item](https://queal.com/en/). I obsessed about eating efficiently for more than ten years, optimizing for effort. I took pleasure in the [dogmatic sacrifices](/i-hate-cars-and-chewing-is-redundant/) I had to make: bland food, no variety, missing out on socializing over food... It didn't matter. My time and mental energy were better spent elsewhere. I adored the idea of my diet, and it worked until it didn't - until I became more serious about fitness. I saw [a dietician](http://www.thesportsnutritioncoach.com/) who convinced me that my diet was interfering with my goals.

This is what the dietician prescribed. This is the habit I grew. This is my diet.

## The layout

My weeks are consistent.

I know the calories and protein of the meals I eat in advance. When I prepare food, I weigh the ingredients used.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/GF4QK0Q.jpg" style="width: 1000px; height: auto;"><br/>

I have a list of meals.

They are interchangeable.

The meal list is my toolkit. I always pick meals from the list, whether planning for lunch or deciding in the moment.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bt9u1QV.jpg" style="width: 1000px; height: auto;"><br/>

My diet started with five meals and a protein shake. I tweaked the calorie count until it suited my goals.
<br/>**Not gaining bodymass?** Add half a meal per day (300kcal / day) and revisit in two weeks.
<br/>**Not losing bodymass?** Remove half a meal per day (300kcal / day) and revisit in two weeks.

5 x meals + 1 x shake = one day of food
<br/>5 x 640kcal + 300kcal = 3500kcal / day

<table style="border: none;">
<tr><th>Weeks</th><th>Measurement</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>1-2</td><td><b>losing</b> bodymass</td><td><b>increase</b> to 5.5 meals, 3800kcal / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4</td><td><b>plateau</b> (maintaining bodymass)</td><td><b>increase</b> to 6 meals, 4200kcal / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-6</td><td><b>gaining</b> bodymass</td><td><b>maintain</b> 6 meals / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>7-8</td><td><b>plateau</b> (maintaining bodymass)</td><td><b>increase</b> to 6.5 meals, 4500kcal / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>8-9</td><td><b>gaining</b> bodymass</td><td><b>maintain</b> 6.5 meals / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>12-13</td><td><b>gaining</b> bodymass</td><td><b>maintain</b> 6.5 meals / day</td></tr>
<tr><td>14-15</td><td><b>plateau</b> (maintaining bodymass)</td><td><b>increase</b> to 7 meals, 4800kcal / day.</td></tr>
</table>

When bulking, I need ~2.2g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For my starting bodymass of 80kg, I needed ~180g protein / day. That's about 700kcal / day or 20% of my calories.

## Habit design

More on how I build habits [here](/habits/).

I want to look better. That's the long-term reward of the diet. There are other rewards, but they don't inspire me. Before pursuing this diet, I struggled to gain lean muscle mass. The last two times I bulked, I gained 5-8kg more bodyfat than I should have.

First, I invested in meeting a dietician. Following their advice, I revamped what I food I eat and I ate with planned consistency. I began to buy the right foods and avoid the wrong foods. I stopped eating outside the diet: junk food, dessert, takeout, delivery, and restaurants. I invest time and willpower in making easy meals available at home and at work. I committed to the lifestyle change and now identify as "someone who is on a strict diet". Throughout the process, I put careful thought into making my diet convenient.

Every day, I make three food decisions: morning at home, midday at work or on-the-go, and evening at home. I don't have the willpower to make hard decisions every mealtime every day. I need the best choices to be the most convenient ones. In the morning and evening at home, the process is foolproof.

I stand at the kitchen counter.

I pick two from the list of meals. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TaqpJkp.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 800px;"><br/>

I "cook" for five minutes.

I eat for ten minutes.

One minute later, I've cleaned up. 15-30 minutes invested.

My midday meal has a higher risk of derailing the habit. I may have less than ten minutes to eat and I may not have any place to prepare food or store perishable ingredients. I may feel peer pressure to get takeout food with friends or colleagues. I need ultra convenient options - portable meals with seconds of preparation time.

Fast option #1: Nuts and chocolate.

Fast option #2: Oat bars.

Fast option #3: Oat flapjacks (baked in advance and frozen).

And that's my diet habit. Those meals satisfy every craving. They fit any schedule. They're always the best choice in the short-term. They're also good choices for my long-term goals.

There's an unavoidable wrinkle in the habit - the unenlightened. When people pressure me into eating/drinking, I have to make unplanned short-term decisions. My default choice is "no thank you", especially for people I know well. For people that don't know me as well, it's difficult to explain my dogma. Refusing an offer to share the experience of food is rejecting an offer for friendship. If food is the medium of socialization and there's no way to avoid it, I mentally prepare myself to make good choices. I pick meals that are as similar to my meal list as possible.
