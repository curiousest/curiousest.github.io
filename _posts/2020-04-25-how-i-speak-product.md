I think and speak in a problem-solving framework. Exceptional product people drilled it into me. When I speak in this problem solving framework, I find myself using a "different language" than others.

# The framework

Every time a person or team puts effort into something, they are working on a solution to some problem. The problem is an opportunity for someone to get new value, and the solution is an approach to capture some of that value.

Ex: this post. The opportunity is that I could be working together more effectively with some colleagues. The solution is to "speak the same language" - write this post, then share it when there's friction.

## That's abstract. How is this useful?

I've observed that people around me are solution-oriented. We like to focus on what needs to be done - the solution. We assume that we're all working on the same problem. Sometimes the problem is obvious, and <i>every second spent clarifying the problem is not spent making the solution happen</i>. Other times the problem is unclear, and clarifying it is worth the investment. With a clearer problem you can make better solution decisions - solutions that capture more value at a lower cost.

I can point to countless projects where I should have clarified the problem more. There are few times where I spent too much time clarifying the problem.

## Still abstract. How do I use this?

Clarifying the problem (or <i>problem definition</i>) means we're getting more specific:

* What opportunities?
* How much value can be captured?
* What stakeholders get that value?
* What is the priority of each opportunity?

You always have multiple potential solutions, and you have to pick which ones we should work on. For each solution, you estimate what opportunities you will capture and the cost to make that happen.

Sometimes you define the problem, list solutions, and pick the best ones. Systematic and explainable.

Other times you intuit a solution to poorly defined problems. It's hard to convince others when they can't evaluate the solution - they don't have your context. They have to trust your intuition. Instead, you can backtrack to explain opportunities and alternative solutions.

### Backtracking example

*Is writing this "How I speak product" article a good solution?*

</td></tr></table>

At some point there's little value in clarifying problems and solutions.

Now I have the tools to explain how writing this article fulfils high-level goals. I can compare the solution to alternatives. I have clarity about where the value lies, so my decisions will bring higher rewards for my effort. 

# Real-life examples

## A developer improving webpage navigation

A developer was adding a new section to the navigation menu of a website for expert users. They saw that the list in the navigation menu was long, and long navigation lists generally should be made into collapsible headings. There was some refactoring required, but the developer believed it's worth making the page easier for the expert users to use.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Q8naLC.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: auto;"><br/>

**Reframing the problem**

The immediate problem was that the navigation pane was slow for the developer to use because there are so many items to look at. The higher-level problem was, there's an opportunity for expert users to use the website more efficiently. The solution was to make headings collapsible to reduce the number of in the list, reducing mental load.

Did this solution have the best value/effort tradeoff for those solutions? The developer didn't think much about it, and this solution can actually deliver negative value. What if expert users memorized the list, and collapsible headings introduces a new click and more muscle-memory? What if expert users work faster with no navigation pane at all?

## Salesperson asks for a small feature

A salesperson just came off of a call with a big, important B2B customer. The meeting gave the salesperson a great idea for an important change to make in the product. The salesperson explained the product changes to the tech lead. They added a feature for expert users to delay taking action on items in their task queue.

**Reframing the problem**

The call with the customer was the second in a row that went poorly. The customer wasn't seeing enough value in the product or progress that would make value increase. The customer mentioned some pain points for their users. One of those pain points looked like it had an easy solution. The salesperson focused their effort on the easy solution, so that they could show progress to the customer in the short term.

The pain point expressed by the customer's users was one of many excuses for low engagement with the product. Low user engagement was the underlying problem - it was causing low product value to the customer. Solving the pain point gave the users one less excuse, but it didn't engage the users.

The second problem was that the customer wanted to know that the product was improving over time. You can give feeling of progress to customers in many ways - sharing roadmaps, reflecting on past growth, demoing R&D results, etc. Using product development resources to give the feeling of progress is highly inefficient.

## Establishing a technical strategy

A senior manager wanted to define a technical strategy for a group of software teams. They had a clear idea of why a technical strategy would be useful. They set up a meeting with a few senior individual contributors from those teams so they could define the strategy together in a meeting.

In the meeting, everyone expressed tangential beliefs and observations. The members had not worked together before, so they used different language and terminology. They didn't agree or disagree on anything and the meeting ended without progress towards a technical strategy.

**Reframing the problem**

Everyone had a different idea of what the technical strategy was for. The group lacked focus for the solution, so they needed to align on the problem. It turned out that the problem was twofold, and the two problems needed different solutions.

In the long term, the group of teams were building the same systems other groups had already built. A vision of a shared platform and cross-team commitment to that vision would reduce costs.

In the short term, a technical strategy was needed to convince senior management stakeholders to allocate resources to the initiative. This is the problem that the senior manager wanted to solve in the meeting.



# Conclusion

Every time a person or team puts effort into something, they are working on a solution to some problem. These things exist, even if we don't think about them every time we work on something.

Every second spent clarifying the problem is not spent making the solution happen. Like all things in product, you must do exactly what is needed and no more.
