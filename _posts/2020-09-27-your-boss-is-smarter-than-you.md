I work in an industry where people want to share information. Technical managers treat knowledge silos as a risk. Product managers are information gatherers and disseminators. Still, there is information asymmetry in the workplace. Here are six little stories from my experience.

## My boss, developing superpowers

I worked at a tech startup from the early stages, and my boss held an executive title. As the company grew in headcount, he grew too. I watched as my boss, as far as I could tell, became exponentially _better_. 

Developers drafted memes celebrating his prowess. Homebrew cult of personality. He humbly dismissed them.

Nontechnical staff fawned over his words. His assertions became commandments, every decision deemed the correct one.

He is a truly great person, but I felt his realized powers were disproportionately great. There were many smart and sociable people at the company, but we celebrated him. The rapid increase in ability didn't make sense to me...

## My undue power

As time passed and the developer team grew, I accrued seniority: interviewing and onboarding our product team's new joiners, providing technical input to business and product decisions, shipping mission-critical features... Whatever question my colleagues had about our system or technology, I could answer off the top of my head. In group contexts, my technical opinions carried unchallengeable weight, and confidently saying *anything* grew my perceived competence and social capital.

I knew my skill and intelligence were not 10x others, but my output per unit of effort was. I realized that the productivity discrepancy between me and other developers was coming from my accumulated company-specific knowledge.

In retrospect, I made so many poor technical decisions with such big consequences. My failures didn't affect my power.

## My boss' boss, solving a hard problem

I once worked as a tech lead where my product was facing a conundrum. We had been using a half-way working solution to a hard problem for a year. Almost half the time, our solution didn't work, and errors had a high cost - our customers' trust. For months, our team thought about how to make significant improvements. But all the options seemed to be big technical investments that we couldn't afford to make. My boss' boss was familiar with the problem but not the current solution. He asked for the codebase and a brief overview. He reviewed it over the weekend and came back with the solution.

**Boss' boss**: "I looked at the code. It's a bit strange and we could make some minor improvements, but there's nothing there we can do to solve our problem."

**Me**: "Yup."

**Boss' boss**: "We can solve the problem a different way, though. The non-tech team XYZ can do it."

**Me**: "Wouldn't that be a huge, continuous manual effort for them?"

**Boss' boss**: "Yes, but it's better than any alternative. I talked to XYZ team manager, and they're on board."

This didn't even register as a possibility to me - to give this whole problem to an unrelated non-technical team in a way that would take an order of magnitude more effort. I didn't know the inner workings or priorities of the other team. I didn't even know that the other team had the skills to solve this problem. With the knowledge I had, I could not see that solution space.

The experience was scary and humbling.

## Successive developers with undue power

I held a product management role. Throughout my involvement, four successive developers found themselves in the position of having the deepest understanding of the technical system comprising the product. I noticed a story arc:

Freshly introduced to the system, the developer struggles. There is little documentation, and Douglas' introductory system overview only hints at the complexity and technical debt. A peer, the other developer of the system, seems to be 10x as productive. The peer barely helps to onboard; they're a silo of knowledge. Suddenly an organizational shift happens and the peer is no longer. The developer is the only realistic individual to take up the mantle of "the developer with the deepest understanding", granted independent of ability. They have the greatest influence over the velocity of product improvements. No one debates the decisions they make. They are perceived as high performers.

They had *real organizational power*, situationally imposed.

## God-mode founder

I was talking with a data scientist on another product. He had just been in their product steering meeting. The business-oriented founder had joined for the first time. My colleague described in amazement,

**Colleague**: "It was incredible! He showed up and just, *ran the meeting*. He grilled us on deep details. Went into so much detail in everything - product, research, business, operations. How can he be that good!?"

**Me**: "Yes, he's similar in our product steering meetings. I think a big part of it is he has all the information. He knows the involvement and ability of every person in the company. He knows what customers care about and how their end-users interact with the product. He understands engineering limitations, how the research team performs experiments, and what experts are doing when they perform an expert task. He knows *everything*."

**Colleague**: "Yeah that makes sense."

*Contemplative pause...*

**Colleague**: "He's still exceptional."

**Me**: "Agreed."

## Perils of knowledge

I joined a big organization that grew fast. Almost all of my colleagues joined within the past year, but the product and system we worked on were a few years old. The sub-group I joined was ~100 people. Three months in, I had a conversation with my boss:

**Boss**: "What problems have you observed in our org?"

**Me**: "Support queries bubble up to two people who know everything. When engineers don't know what to do, they ask those same two people. One of them is good at deflecting, but the other isn't. The hardest problems go to them. It's self-perpetuating and ruins their productivity."

**Boss**: "Yeah, I've talked to them about this. Their impact would be so much higher making improvements. I'm trying to get them to focus their efforts on contributions more than getting distracted supporting. They get sucked into helping others, and never get to do the deeply fulfilling things they're interested in."

**Me**: "Agreed. But I would also like to see more onboarding and in-person sharing sessions. Surely they could put more effort there."

**Boss**: "The org hired many engineers. Many of those onboarded engineers switched teams or left the company. Right now, people are wary of investing in colleagues who leave soon after."

## Conclusion

When someone in your organization seems more intelligent or capable, have a think. How much of it is:

* accumulated org-specific knowledge?
* access to the latest information?
* actual ability and experience?

When someone in your organization seems less intelligent or capable, consider: if they had your org-specific information and access, how much better could they be?

Maybe you should share.
