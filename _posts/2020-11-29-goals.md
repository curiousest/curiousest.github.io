I was 25 years old, a few months into a new job and a new city. My career was finally on a good trajectory. But my broader life - was I on the right track? It felt like "no", but I couldn't say why or what to change. That left me anxious.

My health, relationships, skills... they weren't *there* yet, and they weren't *getting there* either. I'd react to problems, but my actions were always [tactical, not strategic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactic_(method)#Distinction_from_strategy). Without clear long-term goals, how could I make far-sighted decisions? It's like I was treating the symptoms of all these diseases instead of preventing them:

- Burnt out? I'll stop working immediately!
- Soft skills blocking a promotion? I'll start schmoozing!
- Lacking fulfilling friendships? There's an app for that!

At first, I made annual goals. Those helped a bit, turning down the volume on that tugging fear, "Am I going in the right direction?" Then I made monthly goals and those cured me, sent me cruising. Finally, I experimented with short-term plans and those gave me productivity superpowers.

## Long-term to mid-term

When I set my annual goals, I reflect on last year, consider my life goals, and work with the constraints of the year. My monthly goals are set the same way:
* I reflect on last month's goals.
  * Ex: "I hit all my health goals. I could stretch myself more there."
* I consider my annual goals.
  * Ex: "I still haven't started that online course."
* I watch out for the constraints of the next month.
  * Ex: "I have a tight deadline at work in two weeks and my friend is visiting soon."

### Example: My 2019 Goals

I wanted to focus my 2019 on improving in areas of life outside work. I tried to get either work-life balance or career progression. In practice, work ended up taking too much of my effort without enough reward. After seven months, I realized I had to change my job to achieve my goals.

"Best-looking physical shape of life" is the favourite goal I've ever had. It's so ambitious and achievable, it's also opinionated and clear. My health goals in July clearly reflect it. I was finishing a bulk-and-cut cycle, engaging health professionals to do it better the next time.

### Goal Categories

<table>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top">
<strong>Health</strong>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:1em">Physical wellbeing (exercise, eating, sleep)</li>
<li style="font-size:1em">Mental wellbeing (mindfulness, stress)</li>
</ul>

Why? My health affects my performance in other areas of life. I also enjoy the activities involved in being healthy.
</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top">

<strong>Work & Industry</strong>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:1em">Current/future jobs</li>
<li style="font-size:1em">Networking and industry context</li>
</ul>

Why? So that I maintain a healthy separation of my career from my personal life. So that I can choose what proportion of effort I want to invest in my work life.
<br><br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top">
<strong>Relationships</strong>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:1em">Family, Friends, and Romantic</li>
</ul>

Why? Relationships are important to me, but I don't put effort into improving them. I need to bring my relationships to the forefront, so I put in the effort they deserve.
</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top">
<strong>Personal Development</strong>
<ul><li style="font-size:1em">Getting better at everything</li></ul>

Why? I am continuous personal improvement, incarnate. I am always thinking about how to become better.

I'm in a good place when most of my goals have to do with building or maintaining <a href="/habits">habits</a>.

In meat-space, how do I write goals? Sometime between 6am-6pm, I get a tea or coffee and sit in my favourite place to drink it. I write, pen and paper, for 20-60min. What I write usually sucks, but I get better at it over time. I learned to enjoy the activity and now I look forward to it.

## Short-term planning

Daily planning is admin overhead. I don't enjoy admin - I plan because it makes me more effective. I found that when I don't plan I'm more likely to waste my time. Moreover, *it's the only way for me to be productive* when I'm not going to work or classes every day. All my plans were overzealous, and they taught me my limits.

I plan my day in the morning after eating, maybe filling in the next two or three days. Sometimes I don't plan a day. The sun still rises, unscheduled.

## Tasks and Admin

I used to track tasks and initiatives with post-it notes (both work and personal). I switched to a virtual Trello Board when my desk filled up. A mentor looked at it and said,

"Douglas, that's a mess. You're doing too many things, so you're doing them poorly. You should be more focused."

Life admin has to live somewhere. I make plans every week or two. I check in on my monthly goals, write a to-do list, and fill in my calendar. Every week or two is a good frequency to consider life admin - frequent enough that I get things done on time, without distracting me from what's important.

## Conclusion

Long-term compass, medium-term checkpoints, and short-term steps.

Long-term goals highlight what I'm aiming for, but the path there is unclear. The further into the future I look, the cloudier it gets. I need medium- and short-term goals to steer me on the visible path, adjusting my direction as the clouds part.

This framework came from a place of anxiety, but it grew into something that empowers me and how I want to live life. I believe everything I do is intentional and that I should always be improving myself. Some of my friends express that I'm not living life to the fullest - that serendipity is missing. I think I can plan "just the right" amount of spontaneity.

I _enjoy_ getting better at things. I get more enjoyment when I exercise great intent.
