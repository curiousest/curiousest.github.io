```
There once was a Duke of Intent,
Made fol'wers wherever he went.
"Come this way!" He would say,
Eight of ten would obey,
Two ro-lling their eyes with contempt.

The charm of the Duke had a flaw -
It grew weaker with every call.
Self-cast, no effect
No goals lay self-set.
Now immune t'the life-giving spell.

Convert maiden of similar drive
Pierced layers of jaded dream life.
Duke self-cast anew,
Purpose hand-made for two,
Spun-fates threads into husband and wife.
```

For Max. Dear friend, may our intent forever entwine us.
