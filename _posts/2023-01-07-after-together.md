I'm in the moment with you.

_Minutes later,_
We're not together,
But I'm warm in the afterglow.
I remember your scent.

_Days later,_ 
My feelings have run their course,
But new ones are born in the space between us.
I remember your voice.

_Weeks later,_
My new feelings have faded too,
But they still touch me when I listen.
I remember your face.

_Months later,_
My feelings have passed away,
But I know _that_ you made me feel.
I remember you.
