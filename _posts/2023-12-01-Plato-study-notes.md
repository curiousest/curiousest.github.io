Kallipolis: utopian city ruled by philosopher-king

Platos cave is just as much about the social implications of going in and out of the cave, as it is about the properties of the cave itself.

Kinda suspicious. Theres this singular thing called the truth and theres a certain kind of person who tends towards it. And theres a couple other kinds of people who tend towards other things, and only tend towards the truth insomuch that it helps them with their other aims.

## apology

## Theaetetus

## Phaedo

## Meno

## Parmenides
### quotes

The facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst the most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and we only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we place ourselves above them.

…let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early. For a young man is a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings himself and philosophy into discredit. A man of thirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct.

# ideas

## platonic forms

Why do things try to survive?
There are things that don’t have physical agency that try to survive  

Ideas surviving
In a simulation, things survive. No physical.
To know if physical things survive, you need an observer that survives too.
Do physical things survive (or exist) without an observer?

On math feeling more true. Some equations don’t need the same justification.

Name the points on spectrum on dialectic computer.
