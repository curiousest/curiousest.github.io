# I fell in love again, again, and again

Once upon a time, I fell in love,
Then I fell in love again.
Then I fell in love again, again, again, again, and again.

Love didn’t work how I thought it did,
Bound to more than just the one.
The more ones I know, the deeper I go,
Exploration had just begun.

Once upon a time, I fell in love,
Then I fell in love again.
Then I fell in love again, again, again, again, and again.

I fell in love with my best friend,
We never stood a chance.
We loved too much, we drowned in love,
We loved all our endless friends.

Once upon a time, I fell in love,
Then I fell in love again.
Then I fell in love again, again, again, again, and again.

I met someone, we had some fun,
We encouraged each other’s love.
Free to love, we could freely love,
I’d finally found the one.

Once upon a time, I fell in love,
Then I fell in love again.
Then I fell in love again, again, again, again, and again.

We had a child, wore my mother’s eyes,
I fell in love again.
Three children more, I fell in love again, again, and again.

Once upon a time, I fell in love,
Then I fell in love again.
Then I fell in love again, again, again, again, and again.
