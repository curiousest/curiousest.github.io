## approach

My prompt to ChatGPT:

> you are a philosophy tutor/mentor and I am a student. I am going to read David Hume's treatise of human nature. What books and sections should I focus on?

Answer:

> David Hume's _A Treatise of Human Nature_ is a foundational work in philosophy, particularly in the areas of empiricism, epistemology, and ethics. Given its depth and complexity, it's beneficial to focus on key sections that highlight Hume's main arguments and contributions. Here are some recommendations on where to focus your reading:

### Book I: Of the Understanding

1. **Part I: Of Ideas, Their Origin, Composition, Connection, Abstraction, etc.**
    
    - **Section 1: Of the Origin of Our Ideas** - This section introduces Hume's distinction between impressions and ideas.
    - **Section 2: Division of the Subject** - Hume outlines his plan for the Treatise.
2. **Part III: Of Knowledge and Probability**
    
    - **Section 6: Of the Inference from the Impression to the Idea** - This section discusses causation, a central concept in Hume's philosophy.
    - **Section 14: Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion** - A crucial section where Hume examines the concept of causality and introduces his notion of constant conjunction.

### Book II: Of the Passions

1. **Part I: Of Pride and Humility**
    
    - **Section 1: Division of the Subject** - An introduction to Hume's views on emotions and their connection to self-conception.
    - **Section 2: Of Pride and Humility, Their Objects and Causes** - This section delves into Hume's analysis of the passions and their origins.
2. **Part III: Of the Will and Direct Passions**
    
    - **Section 3: Of the Influencing Motives of the Will** - Here, Hume discusses how desires and aversions influence human actions.

### Book III: Of Morals

1. **Part I: Of Virtue and Vice in General**
    
    - **Section 1: Moral Distinctions Not Deriv’d from Reason** - Hume argues that moral distinctions are not the product of reason alone.
    - **Section 2: Moral Distinctions Deriv’d from a Moral Sense** - This section presents Hume’s argument that moral judgments are based on feelings.
2. **Part II: Of Justice and Injustice**
    
    - **Section 1: Justice, Whether a Natural or Artificial Virtue?** - Hume explores the nature of justice and its role in society.

### Additional Resources and Commentary

To complement your reading of Hume's _Treatise_, consider the following secondary sources which provide helpful commentary and analysis:

1. **"Hume: An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding"** by David Hume (ed. Tom L. Beauchamp) - This work distills some of the key ideas from the Treatise in a more accessible format.
2. **"The Philosophy of David Hume"** by Norman Kemp Smith - A classic and comprehensive commentary on Hume's philosophy.
3. **"Hume's 'A Treatise of Human Nature': An Introduction"** by John P. Wright - This book provides a detailed introduction and analysis of the Treatise.
4. **"The Cambridge Companion to Hume"** edited by David Fate Norton and Jacqueline Taylor - A collection of essays by various scholars covering different aspects of Hume's philosophy.

## A Treatise on Human Nature

## book 1

## p1s1: Of the Origin of our Ideas

* All perceptions of the human mind are either impressions or ideas.
* The difference between perceptions and ideas is the "degree of force and liveliness" when activated in mind.
* Impressions: perceptions with the most force.
	* Includes senses, passions, and emotions
* Ideas: faint images of impressions used for thinking and reasoning.
	* Perceptions from reading, other than sensory experiences.
* Impressions and ideas are sometimes similar, but mostly completely different.
* Simple perception: indivisible
* Complex perception: divisible
	* Ex: an apple, has colour, taste, smell


Impressions resemble ideas in every respect except "degree of force and liveliness".

Ideas are resembling of impressions. Many of our complex ideas never had impressions resembling them. Many of our complex impressions are never copied by ideas.

There is resemblance between complex ideas and impressions, but they are not exact copies. Every simple idea has a simple impression that resembles it.

> All our simple ideas, when they first appear, are derived from simple impressions which correspond to them and which they exactly represent.

Argument for this to be the case:
* They always present together, so they're probably related.
* Simple impressions always come first.
* If someone lacks the ability to experience a particular simple impression (eg. blind), then they can't get the simple idea.
* It's possible to get an idea without a perception, but it's a niche edge case (ex: your mind can fill in a blank spot in a spectrum of colours)

## p1s2: Division of the subject

Types of impressions:
- sensation: arise in "the soul itself" from unknown causes
- reflection: derived from our ideas

An impression strikes on the senses and makes us perceive the sensation (heat/cold, etc). The mind makes a copy after the impression ceases - an idea. When the idea recurs "in the soul" (ex: pain), it produces new impressions of reflection (ex: aversion). Those impressions of reflection turn into ideas, which can generate new impressions, recursively.

## p3s6: The inference from the impression to the idea

"Objects in themselves" do not imply the existence of anything else. An inference like existence implying existence would be knowledge, and would mean it's impossible to conceive of anything different. Obviously we can conceive of something different.

We use experience to infer the existence of one object from the existence of another. Whenever we learn a cause-effect pair, both the cause and effect were perceived by the senses and are remembered. When we reason about a cause-effect pair, one is perceived/remembered and the other is activated based on our experience.

Contiguity and succession are not sufficient to make us see a cause-effect pair. We need to see the pair occur multiple times.

A constant conjunction (cause-effect pair) implies that the cause and effect have always had consistent contiguity and succession with each other. A constant conjunction can't reveal any new idea.

The "necessary connection" depends on the inference, and not the other way around. How does experience produce the effect? Is it with imagination or reason?

If we used reason, then we would be relying on the principle:
> Instances of which we haven’t had experience must resemble those of which we have; the course of Nature continues always uniformly the same.

That principle would either be based on certain knowledge or probability. We can conceive of a change in nature, so it's possible.

Probability is about relations of objects, less so ideas, so it must be based on impressions. Probable reasoning about ideas would be fluffy/untrustworthy. Probably reasoning needs something present in the mind sensed or remembered, which infers something that is not seen or remembered.

The only thing that can lead us beyond the immediate impressions of memory and senses is cause and effect. The idea of cause and effect is derived from experience, where constant conjunctions happened. 

Probability is based on the presumption that objects we have no experience of will resemble objects we do have experience of. This presumption can't arise from probability itself. One principle can't be both the cause and effect of another.

The production of one object by another implies a power, and this power is connected with its effect. The power doesn't lie in the perceptible qualities of the cause, but all we have are the perceptible qualities. At best, experience proves that the object was able to produce another object at that point in time. It can't be used to explain other objects or points in time.

Reason doesn't reveal the ultimate connection between cause and effect. And after we experience a constant conjunction, reason doesn't explain why the experience should extend beyond particular instances. Reason can never show us a connection of one object with another, even with the help of experience. When the mind passes the impression or idea from one object to another, it's using some force that isn't rationality.

> Inference depends solely on the unreasoned union of ideas.

Three types of union:
- resembling
- continuous to
- connected with it

Causation is a "philosophical relation" because it involves contiguity, succession, and constant conjunction. Its only role as a "natural relation" is that it produces a union among our ideas and enables us to reason and draw inferences.
## p3s14: The idea of necessary connection

For two objects that are related as cause and effect, they are continuous in time and place, and the cause comes before the effect. Nothing else is related about them.

The words ‘efficacy’, ‘agency’, ‘power’, ‘force’, ‘energy’, ‘necessity’, ‘connection’, and ‘productive quality’, are all nearly synonymous, so they shouldn't be used to define one-another.

Power: whatever brings about new productions in the world of matter

- reason alone can't give rise to an original idea
- reason (separately from experience) can never make us conclude that a cause is required for every "beginning of existence"

There must be some cause where the effect is efficacy.

Cartesians argue that matter has no efficacy. They say that something has to give power, and that something is God. Hume argues that if every idea comes from an impression, then the idea of God must too.
