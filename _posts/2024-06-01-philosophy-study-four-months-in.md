- Republic, an undisputed classic of philosophy and fairly easy to read. Includes the famous cave allegory!

- Apology, because it contains such awesome philosophy on what philosophy is – and what it is good for.

- Theaetetus, if you are interested in the fundamental epistemological question: What is knowledge?

- Phaedo, for Plato’s take on the mind and soul.

- Meno, for Plato’s take on virtue and intrinsic ideas.


- Nicomachean Ethics. An immensely influential yet easy to read work on Aristotelian virtue ethics. (We will return to Aristotle later.) If you get pumped up enough, do continue to its sequel Politics.

- Meditations on First Philosophy, one of the true classics of all time, this work takes a sceptical approach to everything that philosophy has hitherto accomplished and sets down the ideal of certain knowledge, and the method to gain it, for which philosophy is known.

- Discourse on the Method, while less approachable than Meditations, this work connects Descartes more tightly to the scientific revolution that was taking place in his lifetime.


- Social Contract. The book that influenced such much of enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the development of republicanism. Begins with the words: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.” Yeah!

- Philosophical Investigations. In a sense this work represents a return to a Socratic ideal of philosophy, common to some other deconstructive works of 19th and 20th century – a string of questions in search of wisdom more than a system of answers.

- Tractatus Logico-philosophicus. If Philosophical Investigations is a journey into the philosophical confusion of a mature thinker, Tractatus is the final-sorry-not-final string of answers of young Wittgenstein that eventually threw him into that confusion. It is an impressive work of logical hubris that arose after modern logic was invented, presenting answers to everything – and yet with the very last sentence, destroying it all. Points for irony!



- Fear and Trembling. If any work ever has laid bare the absurdity, beauty, and terror of human existence in its purity, it is this. Kierkegaard deconstructs the story of Abraham and Isaac with amazing acuity, setting ethics and religion, knowledge and faith, on a collision course that makes madness seem like wisdom and wisdom – madness.

- Either/Or. Pits aesthetic life against ethical life, desires against duties, and by doing so goes deep indeed into this fundamental conflict within humans.

- Metaphysics. This, alongside Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, is probably the most momentous work in the history of western philosophy, and as dry as it may appear, it should be read by anyone serious about philosophy, contain as it does the foundations for all the metaphysics that came after.

- Organon. A collection of works that laid down the foundations of logic and conceptual analysis – I especially recommend Categories and the Prior and Posterior Analytics.

- Poetics. The first work in literary theory ever written and an indispensable work for anyone interested in aesthetics.


- Summa theologica. Medieval philosophy has been anything but in vogue for the longest time now, considered boring, arcane, and useless by many – the term scholastic that refers to this period of philosophy is synonymous for dry. Yet it would be folly to ignore the wonderful fireworks of reason that can be found in the pages of Summa theologica.


- A Treatise of Human Nature. This defining work of Hume spells out the scientific method of empiricism, the famous problem of induction, and Hume’s fork: there can be no is from ought.

- An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Develops the themes found in the Treatise.

For my learning style, I think I'll be following roughly the same process for every work.

[Here's an example, where I studied J. J. Rousseau & "The Social Contract"](2024-02-08-Rousseau-study-notes).

1. Get the gist of it.
	1. Understand the philosopher. Where they came from, who came before them, the outline of their main ideas, agreements/disagreements after them. Wikipedia, YouTube lectures, [Encyclopedia](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) entries, etc.
	2. Look at the outline of the piece. Wikipedia, YouTube lectures, Encyclopedia entries, etc.
2. Consume it.
	1. Some things are hard to consume. 🧘‍♂️
	2. The style and medium is part of the message.
	3. [This video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uiNB-6SuqVA&list=PL7YPshZMeLIa2KksLNqmWx_SANbSjaUbU&index=9&pp=iAQB) really helped me understand how to retain information while reading.
3. Produce something from it.
	1. I write notes as I read, summarizing each section.
	2. I explain key concepts I’m excited about to friends/family around.
	3. I update parts of the book I’m writing.
	4. I take note of new ideas that inspired me, from what I read.

Staying in London doesn’t feel right for this. I have the wrong habits here for this kind of thing, and I now have significant physical freedom. [I already did the "backpack across the world" thing](2013-08-23-itinerary), and that doesn't feel right either - I don't want to be distracted by *everything*.

I plan on visiting family and friends for long stretches, ideally a month or so in different spots with short transitional stops. First visiting Vienna, then eventually making my way to Germany. I plan on spending the summer at my family cottage in Canada, and hitting up Toronto/Waterloo/California.

I don’t really know how this next year will go. But my last two years have been so full of rapid personal development, that I hope this year cements all of it into foundations for something new.
