Artists suffer because they consume their own minds, and minds contain far more pain than pleasure. After enough painful practice, artists become fine paintbrushes. Fine paintbrushes learn to yearn to paint paintings of paintbrushes painting. A painting can be useful, but we don't need very many paintings of paintbrushes or paintbrush factories or paintbrush business models or paintbrush metaphysics... Useful paintings teach us a useful new idea at the crux of the painting and fine paintbrushes are the finest teachers, but paintbrushes are motivated by self-expression - painting paintbrushes. They tend to want to teach about painting. A paintbrush is just a common tool, a commonly useful painting uses self-expression to reject utility, and recursively meta paintbrushes paint the same common strokes.

Ignore paintings of paintbrushes, and avoid painting any paintings of paintbrushes yourself.
