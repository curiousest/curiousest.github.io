If you take a big knife out anywhere in first-world culture, people will be like, "what are you doing with that big knife?" And you might even get arrested just for carrying it around.

Big knives are useful in the jungle, you should really have one if you'll be walking around in the jungle. But carrying a knife like that around in a first-world culture? No, of course not.

Maybe in a place like America. People carry around large knives and guns, and that's the culture there, but of course, it's very nuanced and localized how that really goes down.

When someone who is used to carrying a big knife around all the time moves to a first-world culture, someone will inevitably try to take their knife away. Of course, the knife-bearer will raise the big knife defensively. All they've ever known is life with the big knife, they have to be shown how to live without it.

The best way forwards for them is to be shown by someone who did it before. Not concealing it or making it just small enough to bend the rules or only taking it out around a particular group of people. No, the ones who did it before put the knife in the most ornate display and paid homage to it every day. They celebrated the culture it inspired, a big-knife take on the new knifeless local one.
