## approach

Instead of starting with skimming the main works before diving in deep, like I've done for other philosophers, I decided to do preliminary reading. I read Prolegomena then a reader's guide, without taking extensive notes. Both were really enjoyable and understandable.

My prompt to ChatGPT:

> you are a philosophy tutor/mentor and I am a student. I am going to read Kant's critique of pure reason. What books and sections should I focus on?

<details>
<summary>Answer  (expand) --> </summary>

 Reading Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" can be quite challenging, but it's incredibly rewarding. Here's a structured approach to help you navigate through this dense text:

### Preliminary Reading:

1. **Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics** by Kant: This is a shorter and more accessible work where Kant outlines his main ideas.
2. **Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason: A Reader’s Guide** by Sebastian Gardner or **Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason': A Guide** by James O'Shea: These secondary texts provide a helpful overview and guide to the main ideas and arguments.

### Primary Focus in "Critique of Pure Reason":

#### Prefaces and Introduction:

1. **Preface to the First Edition (A Preface)**: Understand the historical context and Kant's motivations.
2. **Preface to the Second Edition (B Preface)**: Offers a clearer and more mature presentation of Kant’s critical project.
3. **Introduction**: Covers key concepts such as a priori/a posteriori knowledge and analytic/synthetic judgments.

#### The Transcendental Doctrine of Elements:

1. **Transcendental Aesthetic**:
    
    - **Section I: Space**
    - **Section II: Time**
    - These sections explain Kant’s theories of space and time as forms of human sensibility.
2. **Transcendental Logic**:
    
    - **Transcendental Analytic**:
        - **Analytic of Concepts**:
            
            - **Chapter I: The Clue to the Discovery of All Pure Concepts of the Understanding**
            - **Chapter II: The Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding (especially the Second Edition)**: This is the famous "Transcendental Deduction" which is central to understanding Kant's argument for how we can have knowledge of the world.
        - **Analytic of Principles**:
            
            - **Chapter I: Schematism**
            - **Chapter II: System of All Principles of Pure Understanding**: Focus on the sections on the Axioms of Intuition, Anticipations of Perception, Analogies of Experience, and the Postulates of Empirical Thought.

#### The Transcendental Doctrine of Method:

1. **Transcendental Dialectic**:
    - **Book II: The Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason**:
        - **Chapter II: The Antinomy of Pure Reason**: Understand the conflicts that arise when reason oversteps its boundaries.

### Supplementary Reading:

1. **Critique of Pure Reason** (abridged editions or commentaries): Look for editions that provide summaries, commentaries, and explanations of the dense philosophical arguments.
2. **Secondary Sources**:
    - **The Cambridge Companion to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason**: Offers a collection of essays by various scholars on key aspects of Kant’s work.
    - **Kant and the Claims of Knowledge** by Paul Guyer: A thorough analysis of the "Critique of Pure Reason".

## takeaways

The "copernican revolution", "subject decides on the contents of reality" is something I had already written about before reading Kant. It's the main plot device in one of the short stories I wrote, and I can see some parallels.

Tendency to look for the thing that explains everything - thing-in-itself. I already had written something about this before reading Kant:

> Humans intuition says “sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, so when the entirety of reality has become magic, human brains begin to hallucinate the properties of the advanced technology that made it this way.

When I tried explaining to someone how not all knowledge comes from experience, I gave the example of us inherently having a conception of time and space. The person I explained it to was initially sceptical, then upon hearing about time and space being somehow inherent in humans, they agreed. When I saw them think, I imagined that they thought,
"Oh, ok, so time+space are written into our genetic code somehow."
The thing is, you can apply the same logic recursively, the next level is to the species as a whole. Ex: not all genetic code in a species has to come from experience. Some aspects of time+space are inherent in having genetic code. Etc, etc.

The knowing machine:
1. Appearances produced by senses
2. Appearances produced by imagination, using concepts/laws
3. Consciousness recognizes appearances matching across both, makes knowledge

# A Critique of Pure Reason

## Preface #2

**Copernican revolution**
before: our knowledge must conform to objects
=> we can never have a-priori knowledge about objects
after: objects must conform to our knowledge (more specifically, our intuitions like the existence of time/space)

## Introduction

### 1. The distinction between pure and empirical knowledge

Our knowledge starts with experience. No knowledge comes before experience.

Just because our knowledge starts with experience, doesn't mean knowledge is entirely made out of experience.

Is there a-priori knowledge? Is there knowledge independent of the senses?

A-priori: independent of all experience
Pure a-priori knowledge: has nothing empirical mixed in

### 2. We have some items of a priori knowledge, and even the common understanding is never without them

Experience never guarantees strict universality of anything.
Universal knowledge has to have some source.
Necessity and universality indicate that knowledge is a-priori.

Causality includes necessary connections and universality of effect.

If you take any thing and imagine every property and attribute is removed from it, you'll still be left with the space that thing occupies. That space is lodged in your "faculty of knowledge", independent of experience.

### 3. Philosophy needs a science to show that there can be a priori knowledge, and to establish its principles and its scope

Some knowledge seems to push beyond the limits of experience.
Like God, freedom, and immortality.
Metaphysics starts off by assuming it's able to handle the task of exploring these phenomena.

Math is an example of how far you can go with a-priori knowledge independent of experience.

Plato started to do this, but he didn't base his ideas on any solid foundations, so he was free to imagine whatever he wanted.

### 4. The difference between analytic and synthetic judgment

Analytic judgement: the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that's hidden inside of A. Ex: all bachelors are single.

Synthetic judgement: the predicate B lies entirely outside of the subject A, but is connected to it. Ex: all bachelors are rich.

Judgements based on experience are all synthetic.
Use principle of contradiction to extract the truth from the analytic judgement.

"Every event has its cause"
It's a synthetic judgement.
Experience can't connect event -> cause, because it's more general than experience can support and the judgement connects them necessarily - a-priori.

"We have to make synthetic a-priori judgements possible."

### 5. All theoretical sciences of reason contain synthetic a priori judgments as principles

Math, natural science, and metaphysics all use synthetic a-priori judgements.

Math
Math judgements are all synthetic.
The principle of contradiction can help prove a synthetic judgement, but another synthetic judgement is always required to prove a synthetic judgement.
Math propositions are all a-priori, so they require necessity.

Geometry has some analytic judgements, but only because those judgements can be intuited.

With Metaphysics we analyse and clarify concepts a-priori. We also seek to enlarge our knowledge a-priori. Purely synthetic a-priori concepts.

### 6. The general problem of pure reason

"How are synthetic a-priori concepts possible?"
Metaphysics has been wishy-washy until now because no one answered this question.

Hume came closest, but he thought that stuff couldn't be known a-priori and reason was all borrowed from experience.

If metaphysics is not a science, then it's at least a natural predisposition. How is metaphysics as a natural disposition possible? It doesn't really matter - it will always get us to produce metaphysics, so we have to figure out why we have metaphysics.

Metaphysics doesn't deal with objects of reason. It deals with reason itself - problems that spring from nature itself, rather than the objects of nature.

Dogmatic metaphysics doesn't work.

### 7. The idea and division of a special science called ‘critique of pure reason’

Reason is the faculty that provides a-priori knowledge.

This is a critique, not a doctrine, of pure reason. Exploration.

Transcendental: knowledge about what makes it possible to know objects a-priori

Transcendental philosophy may not contain anything empirical

Two stems of human knowledge:
- sensibility: where objects are given to us (can be a-priori if it's the conditions where objects can be given to us)
- understanding: where objects are thought

## Transcendental aesthetic

### 1

Intuition: the way objects relate to knowledge, immediately. Our ability to be knowingly confronted by individual things.

Sensibility: the capacity for getting representations that lead to us being affected by objects

Understanding: thinking through objects

Appearance: an empirical intuition of. The result of an intuition that's related to its object through sensation.

The form of the appearance must already be in the mind to order/pattern the appearance. So the form is a-priori. The appearance is a-posteriori.

If you have a body, then remove from the representation of the body:
- everything the understanding thinks - substance, form, divisibility
- everything to do with sensation - hardness, colour, etc.
You are left with extension and shape. These belong to pure intuition.

Transcendental aesthetic: the science/principles of a-priori sensibility

Transcendental logic: principles of pure thinking

In the transcendental aesthetic, remove everything that understanding thinks, then remove everything sensed, and we are left with empirical intuition, which reduces to time and space.

### 2 Metaphysical exposition of space

Outer sense: represent objects as outside us and all in space.

Inner sense: internal states and representations. Doesn't operate in a manner parallel to the outer sense. Time.

What are space and time? Options:
- beings
- properties/relations among things
- relations that attach via intuition, and don't really exist outside of our minds

Space:
- is not an empirical concept derived from outer experiences. Space has to be there in mind before relating happens.
- is a necessary a-priori representation that underlies outer intuitions. It's required for any representation of state-of-affairs. It's a precondition for the possibility of appearances.
- isn't a general concept. It's pure intuition. We can only represent a single space, and separate spaces are considered part of the single space. It isn't assembled by pieces - it's there and things are in it. It is essentially single, and we mark boundaries inside of it to generate complexity.
- Infinite given magnitude.

### 3. Transcendental exposition of the concept of space.

Space isn't a property of or set of relations among objects-in-themselves. (properties and relations can't be intuited a-priori)

Space is nothing but the form of all appearances of outer sense. It's the condition for sensibility.
A mind's ability to be affected has to come before the affection. It's only from the human standpoint that we can talk about space.

Space is empirically real and transcendentally real. It's both externally the same and subjectively the same across all humans.
Colours, in contrast, are the same externally, but internally might be experienced differently.

### 4. Metaphysical exposition of the concept of time

Time is not an empirical concept drawn from experience.
To represent things as existing in parallel or series, we need a presupposed representation of time.

We can have the thought of time without any appearances - time when nothing exists/happens.
We can't have the thought of events without time.

Time has one dimension and different times are not simultaneous, but successive. Just like space is not successive but simultaneous.

Time being infinite is an intuition. Any limited cut of time must be possible. To be this way, time has to be intuitively infinite.

### 5. Transcendental exposition of the concept of time

### 6. Conclusions from these concepts

Time isn't a separate object or something that objects can have. 

Time is the a-priori condition of all appearances. Space is the pure form of outer intuitions, but outer intuitions have to be represented internally, so they need to conform to time.

We can't say, "all things are in time"
We can say, "all appearances of things are in time"

### 7. Elucidation

Nothing other than space and time are a-priori in the same way. Everything else requires some experience.

organon: complete account of how reason does its pure work. Scope, principles, concepts.
canon: the part of an organon that allows us to judge pure uses of reason.

### 8. General remarks on the transcendental aesthetic

* All our intuition is nothing but the representation of appearance.
* The things we intuit are not complete or true representations of them. Our intuitions aren't even necessarily related to those things in the way we think.
* If we stripped off the story of our mind, all structure between things would disappear, then space and time would disappear, because all those things exist only in us.

We know nothing about objects-in-themselves, except through our sensibility. That perception is special to us, and might not be the same for other beings.

Our sensibility is a confused, self-entangled representation of things.

For the mind to know about itself, it has to change itself and then feel the result of the change. The mind can't intuit its actual self, because its intuition is passive and sensible. It can only intuit the appearance of change.

If space/time have objective reality, then you'd have two infinite things with crazy properties that makes everything hard to make any sense of.

## Logic Introduction: The Idea of a Transcendental Logic

### 1. Logic in general

Knowledge comes from
- getting representations (objects given to us)
- the power to achieve knowledge through the representations (thought using the objects)

Intuitions and concepts can be pure or empirical. Containing or not containing sensation. Pure is a-priori, empirical is a-posteriori.

The two functions are both necessary and non-exchangeable. They should be inspected independently.
Aesthetic: science of sensibility
Logic: science of understanding.

Logic breaks down into general vs. special.
General: logic of elements. Pure or applied.

General logic: filters out content of the knowledge through the understanding. Has to do with the form of thinking.

Pure logic: no empirical principles. A-priori.

### 2. Transcendental logic

Pure intuitions vs. empirical ones.
Thoughts of objects can be pure vs. empirical.

Pure thoughts of objects are concerned with the origin of items of knowledge.
He's expecting that there's objects that can be related to concepts a-priori.

### 3. The division of general logic into analytic and dialectic

Truth: the agreement of knowledge with its object.
What is truth? = What is the general and certain criterion of truth of any item of knowledge?

If truth has to do with objects, then objects must be distinguishable from other objects.
The notion of a single criterion of truth is false.

Universal and necessary rules of understanding are necessary for the truth (but not sufficient).

Something agreeing with logical laws doesn't mean it's true. So you can't just use logic alone - you have to use solidly based information from the outside. When general logic is used in this way, it's called dialectic.

Dialectic: logic of illusion. Tricks and pretending methodical thoroughness.

### 4. The division of transcendental logic into analytic and dialectic

Transcendental analytic: the part of transcendental logic that expounds the elements of pure knowledge yielded by the understanding + the principles required for an object to be thought.

Transcendental analytic should be a canon for evaluating the use of understanding
Transcendental analytic should *not* be an organon of a general and unrestricted use of understanding. You shouldn't be using it to operate on imagined objects, not tied to empiricism.

Transcendental analytic:
- concepts must be pure
- concepts must belong to thinking and understanding, not intuition and sensibility
- concepts must be elementary and distinguished from more complex ones that are built out of them
- the list of concepts must be complete

To be complete, need:
1. an idea of the totality of a-priori knowledge provided by the understanding
2. the classification of concepts that such an idea generates
3. the inter-connections among those concepts, making them constitute a system

## Analytic of concepts

## Chapter 1: Metaphysical Deduction

### 1. The logical use of the understanding in general

So far, understanding is the non-sensible faculty of knowledge (negative definition).
Can't have intuition that isn't sensible, so there can't be any intellectual intuition, so understanding doesn't involve intuition.

Understanding has to be knowledge through concepts.
Understanding is discursive rather than intuitive.
Intuitive: knowing about something by being confronted by it
Discursive: knowing about something by having a description, thinking, or concept applies to it.

Intuition comes from passive states while concepts come from active states.

1. A concept unifies many items. Judgements are a kind of structuring a concept.
2. The items that a concept brings together are representations (something that covers both concepts and intuitions).
3. Understanding is a faculty of thinking & judging (judging is a subset). Thinking is operating with concepts. The only use understanding can make of concepts is to judge by means of them.
### 2. The logical function of the understanding in judgements

For the form and not content of judgements, there are 12 categories:
**Quantity**
- singular
- particular (some)
- universal (all)
**Quality**
- affirmative (is x)
- negative (is not x)
- infinite (is non-x)
**relation**
- categorical
- hypothetical
- disjunctive (chained or's)
**modality**
- problematic
- assetoric
- apodictic

non-x and not x and pretty much the same.

### 3. The pure concepts of the understanding, i.e. categories

Understanding is active. For understanding to have knowledge of space&time a-priori, it has to go through it, take it up, and pull it together somehow. This is called synthesis.

Synthesis: the action of assembling different representations and grasping their variety in one item of knowledge.

If we want to know about the first origin of our knowledge, we need to look at its synthesis.

Transcendental knowledge teaches us how to bring the pure synthesis of representations to concepts.

Table of categories:
**quantity**
- unity
- plurality
- totality
**quality**
- reality
- negation
- limitation
**relation**
- inherence and subsistence
- causality and dependence
- community
**modality**
- possibility - impossibility
- existence - non-existence
- necessity - contingency

Aristotle's list had some sensibility ones and empirical ones that didn't belong. And it was missing some.

The table provides all the elementary concepts of the understanding. It provides the form (but not the content) of a system of them in human understanding.

The table can be split into two parts:
- to do with the objects of intuition (mathematical)
- to do with the existence of objects in relation to each other or to understanding (dynamical)

In each of the trios, the third is made up of the first two. Community is a special case.

## Chapter 2: Transcendental deduction

### 1. The principles of any transcendental deduction

Things like fortune and fate are permitted in everyday speech, but when we inspect them more closely, they can't be explained by experience or reason.

We have two groups of concepts which both relate to concepts a-priori:
- space and time
- the categories, as concepts of the understanding

We don't need to deduce them empirically because they apply to concepts without having to borrow from experience.

How knowledge comes to be:
- impressions of the senses provide the first trigger for opening all of knowledge to them, and come into existence as experience
- experience contains:
	- matter for knowledge acquired by the senses
	- form for ordering this knowledge
- the occurrence of sensory matter is what triggers the form and brings concepts into play

It's more obvious how space and time apply to objects intuitively a-priori. It's not as obvious for the categories.

Objects of sensible intuition must fit the formal conditions of sensibility a-priori. (obvious)

Objects of sensible intuition must fit the conditions that the understanding requires for the synthetic unity of thinking.

### 1/2 Final step towards the transcendental deduction of the categories

How can a synthetic representation and its object come to terms with each other?
Either
1. the object makes the representation possible
2. the representation makes the object possible

1 means no a-priori representations.
2 not like "the representation creates the object", more like "only through the representation can the object be known"

An object can be known when there is:
- an intuition, through which the object is given (although only in appearance)
- a concept, through which the object corresponding to the intuition is thought

All experience contains:
- intuition of the senses through which something is given
- a concept of an object that is given in intuition (the framework/space where an object can be given)

The objective validity of the categories rests on the fact that experience is only possible through them. A-priori concepts are a-priori conditions of the possibility of experience. Those concepts are therefore necessary.

Three sources of experience: sense, imagination, self-awareness.
They are the basis for:
- the a-priori "synopsis of the manifold" through sense
- synthesis of the manifold through imagination
- unity of the synthesis through self-awareness

### 2. The a priori bases for the possibility of experience

A concept can be produced a-priori if:
- it is contained in the concept of possible experience
- or it consists of the elements of possible experience

> What are the a priori conditions that •make experi- ence possible, and that •remain as its substructure even when everything empirical has been filtered out from appearances?

Thinking about an object involves more than the faculty of understanding.

If each representation was standalone, never interacted with each other, knowledge wouldn't be possible.

What faculty is responsible for referencing objects?

Three acts of synthesis in all knowledge:
1. apprehending representations as states of mind in intuition
2. reproducing them in imagination
3. recognizing them as a concept

### 2/1 The synthesis of apprehension in intuition

All our knowledge is subject to time because it belongs to inner sense. They have to be ordered, connected, and inter-related in time.

Every intuition contains a manifold (variety of different elements).
A manifold requires different times for the different elements.
For the manifold to give rise to a unified intuition, it must first be run-through and held together.
Synthesis of apprehension: the act of running through and holding together.
SoA can be a-priori or empirical.

### 2/2 The synthesis of reproduction in imagination

There has to be something that make the reproduction of appearances possible. The a-priori basis for the synthetic unity of appearances.

If we can show that a manifold is structured in a way to make throughgoing synthesis possible,
then we can show that the synthesis of imagination is based on a-priori principles in advance of experience.

Any mental activity like drawing a line in thought or think about a particular time or number, requires apprehending a series of elements in a time-taking manifold.

The synthesis of apprehension (transcendental basis for any items of knowledge) & synthesis of imagination (presupposed for any empirical acts of thinking) together make up the transcendental faculty of imagination.

### 2/3 The synthesis of recognition in a concept

The unitary consciousness is what makes a single representation out of the manifold that is intuited by iterating along time, then reproduced in imagination.

Consciousness must always be present, otherwise there are no concepts or knowledge of objects.

Object of representations (transcendental object): the form surrounding "something = x"

There must be a transcendental basis for:
- the unity of consciousness in the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions
- for the concept of objects in general
- for all objects of experience

Transcendental self-awareness: the always-present, passive, "I think". It is the a-priori basis for all concepts.

The mind's consciousness of its own identity is also a consciousness of a unity of the synthesis of all appearances according to concepts.

The transcendental object gives objective reality to empirical concepts, makes concepts refer to objects.

If objects are given to us through appearances, then the appearances must fall under the a-priori rules of synthetic unity of self-awareness. Otherwise knowledge is not possible.

### 2/4 Preliminary explanation of the possibility of the categories as items of a priori knowledge

The form of experience is the throughgoing synthetic unity of perceptions. It is the synthetic unity of perceptions in accordance with concepts.

Categories are the a-priori conditions of thought. They are conditions for the possibility of experience.

Everything we know or think has to come through basic self-awareness. The "I" has to run through it all, and we know this a-priori. So every appearance must satisfy whatever is needed to go past the "I".

### 3. The understanding’s relation to objects as such, and the possibility of knowing them a priori

We can have experience because of: sense, imagination, and self-awareness.

Sense represents appearances in perception.
Imagination represents appearances in association/reproduction.
Self-awareness represents appearances in recognition.

Self-awareness ties the other two together. Self-awareness recognizes that an imaginatively produced representation is the same as one you had in a previous perception.

Pure self-awareness supplies the principle of the synthetic unity of the manifold in all possible intuition.

Knowledge is possible because of a necessary unifying work of pure synthesis of imagination, prior to self-awareness.

- The transcendental unity of the synthesis of imagination underlies the unity of self-awareness
- The unity of self-awareness underlies the possibility of all knowledge
- Therefore the "transcendental unity of the synthesis of imagination" is needed for any knowledge to be possible and for any objects of possible experience to be represented a-priori.

How categories help the understanding come to grips with appearances:
1. Every appearance contains a manifold
2. Different perceptions occur in the mind separately and on their own
3. Perceptions have to be combined in a way that passive sense doesn't provide
This active faculty of synthesizing the manifold is imagination.

You have to put past perceptions beside current ones to make knowledge, but you can't just do that randomly.

Hilarious quote:
> The objective unity of all empirical consciousness in the single consciousness of basic self-awareness is thus a necessary condition for any possible perception; and therefore the affinity of all appearances, near or remote, is a necessary consequence of a synthesis in imagination which is grounded a priori on rules.

Imagination (generation of concepts) is necessary to meld with perceptions to make a unitary experience.

Understanding is:
- an active cognitive faculty
- a power of thought
- a faculty of concepts
- a faculty of judgements
- **the faculty of rules**

Rules make up nature, instead of nature making up the rules. (nature being, the causal order of things)
Nature is the synthetic unity of the manifold of appearances according to rules.

All "appearances as possible experience" are a-priori in the understanding, and receive their formal possibility from the understanding.
All "appearances as intuitions" are in the sensibility and their form is only possible through the sensibility.

If the objects in our knowledge were things-in-themselves, we couldn't have a-priori concepts of them.

About appearances:
- they are all in me
- they are states of myself
- there is a complete unity of them in one-and-the-same self-awareness

## 2. Transcendental deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding

### 2/1 The possibility of combination as such

The concept of combination involves:
- the concept of the manifold
- the concept of its synthesis
- the concept of the unity of the manifold

The concept of the unity of the manifold must precede a-priori all concepts of combination because:
- categories are based on kinds of judgement
- a judgement can be made only if some combination is already thought
- the category "unity" presupposes that some combination has already occurred and that concepts are already unified
- we have to look earlier in the process for the unity of the manifold

### 2/2 The basic synthetic unity of self-awareness

Pure self-awareness: as opposed to empirical self-awareness. Presupposed by all your thoughts and intuitions, so it can't result from looking inwards.

Basic self-awareness: the self-consciousness that produces the representation "I think". Can't be accompanied by or derived from any further representation.

Transcendental self-awareness: indicating a-priori self-awareness

The analytical (pulling apart) unity of self-awareness is only possible under the presupposition of some synthetic one.

### 2/3 The principle of the synthetic unity of self-awareness is the supreme principle of all use of the understanding

Supreme principle governing how intuitions relate to the understanding:
1. the manifolds of sensibility satisfy the formal conditions of space and time
2. the manifolds of intuition satisfy the conditions of the basic synthetic unity of self-awareness

### 2/4 What the objective unity of self-consciousness is

Three levels of unity:
1. the subjective unity of consciousness. Unified in the thought, "I think"
2. the objective unity of consciousness (transcendental unity of self-awareness). Pull together various items in sensory field and unify them as all being of some object.
3. the empirical unity of self-awareness / self-consciousness
3 depends on 2 depends on 1.

### 2/5 The logical form of all judgments consists in the objective unity of the self-awareness of the concepts that the judgments contain

Logicians say that  a judgment is the representation of a relation between two concepts."
But that doesn't express what the relation is between the two concepts.

Use the relation in the realm of understanding, not imagination.

Subjective relation in the mind: "when I hold this body, I feel an impression of weight"
Objective relation in the objects: "it, this body, is heavy"

### 2/6 All sensible intuitions conform to the categories, because otherwise their manifold can’t come together in one consciousness

The action of understanding is done through the basic kinds of judgement.
The logical shape of these kinds of judgements is a category.
The manifold in any intuition conforms to the categories.
### 2/7 Remark

Imagine a (divine) understanding that produced objects at the same time as representing them, instead of representing objects given to it from elsewhere. The categories would not be useful to it. Categories are rules for an understanding that can't do anything except think.

We can't explain why this involves the twelve categories anymore than we can explain why space and time are the only two forms of our intuition.

### 2/8 The only work a category can do in the knowledge of things involves applying it to objects of experience

The only work a category can do in the knowledge of things involves applying to objects of experience.

### 2/9

Space and time only have meaning within the limits of experience. Outside of that boundary, they don't represent anything at all. They are within the senses and have no reality outside of them. Concepts beyond our sensible intuition are merely empty objects to us, we can't even judge where there could be objects.

### 2/10 The application of the categories to objects of the senses as such

Categories are just the mere forms of the thought. They don't say anything about what object is there. So how do we get a-priori knowledge through the understanding?

The synthesis that is embodied in the categories is the basis for the possibility of a-priori knowledge.

Two syntheses that understanding performs:
- figurative synthesis: synthesis of the manifold of intuition. Uses imagination.
- combination: synthesis that the understanding performs just through categories

Synthetic unity of self-awareness is different than inner sense.
Synthetic unity of self-awareness:
- is the source of all combination
- applies to the manifolds of intuitions in general
- applies, in the role of categories, to objects in general, prior to all sensible intuition
Inner sense:
- contains the form of intuition, without any pulled-together manifold in it
- doesn't yet contain any determinate intuition

Determinate intuition: detailed sensory state

How can the "I" that actively things be different than the "I" that passively thinks?
They exist at different points in time in the same "I".

### 2/11

## The analytic of principles

When reason is used in a transcendental way, the result is illusion, not truth. Reason has to be handled with the transcendental dialectic, not the analytic.

The analytic of principles is canon of judgement.

### Introduction: Transcendental judgment in general

Understanding is the faculty of rules, judgement is the faculty of applying rules. General logic can't apply rules - it can't decide when is appropriate to apply, it can only apply.

Examples sharpen judgement.

Philosophy mostly does negative around judgement - what not to do.

Since everything in transcendental philosophy is a-priori, it has to a-priori provide both the rules and judgements about when to apply them.

Schematism: sensible conditions where pure concepts of the understanding can be applied.

Principles of pure understanding: synthetic judgements that flow a-priori from pure concepts of the understanding and form an a-priori basis for all other items of knowledge.

### Chapter 1: The schematism of the pure concepts of the understanding

[meta: it's like he's trying to describe machine learning when the only thing anyone knows about is rule-based systems]

Whenever an object is "brought under" (merged in the understanding with) a concept, the object must "be the same sort" as the concept. They have to contain the same stuff.

Pure concepts of the understanding have nothing in common with empirical intuitions.

How can we apply the categories to appearances? (ex how to apply causality to an appearance)
There has to be some third thing that's like the category and the appearance, both intellectual and sensible. That is the transcendental schema.

Transcendental schema: for any category C, the representation of C-in-time. (categorical inclusion + temporality of sensibility).

1. Concepts mean nothing to us unless an object is given for the concept or the elements that make up the concept
2. Objects are only ever given through states of our sensibility
3. Pure a-priori concepts must contain 
	1. Whatever they need to go through the work of understanding
	2. a-priori formal conditions of sensibility - for the category to be applied to the object

Schema of a concept of understanding: the formal and pure conditions of sensibility restricting the concept

The schema is only a product of the imagination. It is not the image. It is a method of representing the image that fits a concept.
. . . . . Is an image of five dots, but the schema is '5', for the category of multitude.

It is schemas and not images that underlie our pure sensible concepts.

The schema of a triangle can't exist anywhere except in thought.

> The schematism of our understanding, in its application to appearances and their mere form, is an art concealed in the depths of the human soul

The image is a product of the empirical faculty of reproductive imagination.
The schema of sensible concepts is a product of pure a-priori imagination.

Categories:
* The pure image of magnitudes is space, the pure image of magnitudes of objects is time, and the pure schema of magnitude is number. It's a representation of successive additions of similar units.
* Reality is a being in time.
* Schema of substance: persistence of the real in time.
* Schema of cause-and-effect: the rule-governed succession in the manifold. Events that unroll through time.
* Schema of community: the rule-governed simultaneity of the states of one with the states of another.
* Schema of possibility: the agreement of the synthesis of various representations with the conditions of time as such (opposites can't exist in one thing at the same time)
* Schema of actuality: existence at some definite time.
* Schema of necessity: existence of an object at all times.

All these schemas contain & make representable, something to do with time.

> •magnitude: the generation (synthesis) of time itself, in the temporally drawn-out apprehension of an object;
> •quality: the synthesis of sensation (perception) with
> the representation of time, i.e. the filling of time;
> •relation: the connection of the perceptions with one another at all times in accordance with a rule of time-determination;  
•modality: time itself, as the correlate of the facts about whether and how an object belongs to time.

Schemas are a-priori rule-governed aspects of time.
Magnitude: time-series
Quality: content of time
Relation: order of time
Modality: scope of time wrt all possible objects

> This makes it clear that the schematism of the understanding....amounts to the unity of all the manifold of intuition in inner sense, and to nothing else. That means that it indirectly comes down to the unity of self-awareness, as the active counterpart to inner sense, which is passive. Thus the schemas of the concepts of pure understanding are what enable the concepts to relate to objects, and thus to have significance; nothing else plays this role. So the bottom line is this: the categories can’t be used in any way except empirically, because all they do is to bring appearances under general rules of synthesis. . . .that make them fit for a thoroughgoing connection in one experience.

* The schematism of the understanding is the unity of all the manifold of intuition in inner sense.
* The schematism of the understanding is, indirectly, the unity of self-awareness.
* The schematism of the understanding is the active counterpart to the passive inner sense.
* The schemas enable concepts to relate to objects.

[Douglas system understanding so far]
Appearances in manifold -> apply schemas in synthesis -> concepts activate.
...? -> ...? -> generate concepts.
Concepts from sensibility + concepts from imagination => recognize overlap.

### Chapter 2: The system of all principles of pure understanding

A-priori principles are the basis for other judgements, and they are not founded on higher or more universal knowledge. They can still be proven, but not in any objective way. They have to be proven, or things are founded on unproven stuff.

#### 1. The supreme principle of all analytic judgments

Judgements have to be not self-contradictory.
The principle of contradiction is universal and the criterion of truth. It belongs only to logic, valid for all knowledge considered as just knowledge. It shows the truth of an analytic judgement.

You shouldn't have to include the concept of time in the expression of the principle. (x and not x "at the same time")

#### 2. The supreme principle of all synthetic judgments

> If knowledge is to have objective reality, i.e. to relate to an object and have meaning and significance in relation to it, the representation of the object must be related to actual or possible experience.

Representations of objects must be related to actual/possible experience, otherwise knowledge generated from those representations is not objectively real.

The possibility of experience is what gives rise to a-priori knowledge.

Experience is the only kind of knowledge that can give reality to other kinds of knowledge.

The supreme principle of all synthetic judgements:
> Every object conforms to the necessary conditions of synthetic unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.

There's some system. Objects that come out of that system must exhibit certain properties, otherwise they couldn't have come out of that system. Otherwise, the objects are not "objectively real".

#### 3. A systematic presentation of all the synthetic principles of pure understanding

All the laws of nature fall under the higher principles of understanding. They apply those higher principles in special cases to the understanding.

Some principles of mathematics are derived through the understanding, and so they aren't principles of the understanding.

When concepts of understanding are applied to possible experience, their synthesis is used as mathematical or dynamical. The synthesis is mathematical when it is concerned with the **intuition** of appearance, while it's dynamical when it is concerned with the **existence** of appearance.

The a-priori conditions of intuition are necessary conditions of any possible experience.
While the conditions of the existence of the objects of a possible empirical intuition are only accidental/contigent.

The principles of using math are necessary.
The principles of using dynamical are a-priori necessary when there's an empirical thought in an experience.

The principles of pure understanding:
- Axioms of intuition
- Anticipations of perception
- Analogies of experience
- Postulates of empirical thought

Mathematical/Dynamical are labels that describe how principles are applied and their "evidentness". 1&2 are mathematical, 3&4 are dynamical.

Connecting: synthesis of things that belong together.
Assembling: synthesis of things that don't necessarily belong together.

#### 1. Axioms of Intuition

**Their principle is: all intuitions are extensive magnitudes.**

All appearances contain an intuition of space and time. This is an a-priori condition of their form.

An object can't be perceived as an appearance without the concept of magnitude happening.

Extensive magnitude: the representation of its parts makes the representation of the whole possible. The representation of the parts has to precede the representation of the whole.

All appearances are intuited as aggregates, as bunches of previously given parts.

The principle makes mathematics applicable to objects of experience. A-priori.

Appearances are not things-in-themselves, but they're all we get. Appearances are what have to satisfy any conditions of our intuitions.

The synthesis of space**s** and time**s** is the essential form of all intuition. That synthesis is what makes us able to be conscious of appearance, and therefore every outer experience. That synthesis is what makes us able to have knowledge of outer objects of experience. Whatever pure mathematics holds for the synthesis of apprehension must also hold for the objects that went through it.

#### 2. Anticipations of perception
