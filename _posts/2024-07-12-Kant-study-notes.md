## approach

Instead of starting with skimming the main works before diving in deep, like I've done for other philosophers, I decided to do preliminary reading. I read Prolegomena then a reader's guide, without taking extensive notes. Both were really enjoyable and understandable.

My prompt to ChatGPT:

> you are a philosophy tutor/mentor and I am a student. I am going to read Kant's critique of pure reason. What books and sections should I focus on?

<summary>Answer  (expand) --> </summary>

 Reading Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" can be quite challenging, but it's incredibly rewarding. Here's a structured approach to help you navigate through this dense text:

### Preliminary Reading:

1. **Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics** by Kant: This is a shorter and more accessible work where Kant outlines his main ideas.
2. **Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason: A Reader’s Guide** by Sebastian Gardner or **Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason': A Guide** by James O'Shea: These secondary texts provide a helpful overview and guide to the main ideas and arguments.

### Primary Focus in "Critique of Pure Reason":

#### Prefaces and Introduction:

1. **Preface to the First Edition (A Preface)**: Understand the historical context and Kant's motivations.
2. **Preface to the Second Edition (B Preface)**: Offers a clearer and more mature presentation of Kant’s critical project.
3. **Introduction**: Covers key concepts such as a priori/a posteriori knowledge and analytic/synthetic judgments.

#### The Transcendental Doctrine of Elements:

1. **Transcendental Aesthetic**:
    
    - **Section I: Space**
    - **Section II: Time**
    - These sections explain Kant’s theories of space and time as forms of human sensibility.
2. **Transcendental Logic**:
    
    - **Transcendental Analytic**:
        - **Analytic of Concepts**:
            
            - **Chapter I: The Clue to the Discovery of All Pure Concepts of the Understanding**
            - **Chapter II: The Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding (especially the Second Edition)**: This is the famous "Transcendental Deduction" which is central to understanding Kant's argument for how we can have knowledge of the world.
        - **Analytic of Principles**:
            
            - **Chapter I: Schematism**
            - **Chapter II: System of All Principles of Pure Understanding**: Focus on the sections on the Axioms of Intuition, Anticipations of Perception, Analogies of Experience, and the Postulates of Empirical Thought.

#### The Transcendental Doctrine of Method:

1. **Transcendental Dialectic**:
    - **Book II: The Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason**:
        - **Chapter II: The Antinomy of Pure Reason**: Understand the conflicts that arise when reason oversteps its boundaries.

### Supplementary Reading:

1. **Critique of Pure Reason** (abridged editions or commentaries): Look for editions that provide summaries, commentaries, and explanations of the dense philosophical arguments.
2. **Secondary Sources**:
    - **The Cambridge Companion to Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason**: Offers a collection of essays by various scholars on key aspects of Kant’s work.
    - **Kant and the Claims of Knowledge** by Paul Guyer: A thorough analysis of the "Critique of Pure Reason".

## takeaways

The "copernican revolution", "subject decides on the contents of reality" is something I had already written about before reading Kant. It's the main plot device in one of the short stories I wrote, and I can see some parallels.

Tendency to look for the thing that explains everything - thing-in-itself. I already had written something about this before reading Kant:

> Humans intuition says “sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, so when the entirety of reality has become magic, human brains begin to hallucinate the properties of the advanced technology that made it this way.
