Memorizing is a waste of time.

That's what I thought my whole student life until I started to learn Chinese. The hardest thing about Chinese is how much memorization there is. For every one thing you memorize in French, you have to memorize like five things in Mandarin! If you were to learn French as an English speaker, you have to memorize:

- direct translations of ~65% of words (~35% of English words come from French)
- grammar & verb conjugations & gender

To learn Mandarin as an English speaker, you have to memorize:

- new concepts (words and idioms don't map 1:1 to direct translations)
- 99% new spoken words
- 100% written words (written text is not phonetic - you have to relearn all the words again)
- grammar & [measure words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classifier) & tones

As someone who had actively avoided memorizing throughout my schooling, this was hard. My first instinct was to figure out how to memorize less. I discovered that **it's easier to "recognize" than it is to "recall".** This is super important for present-day LLM usage.

> To recognize: to identify something you've seen before.
> To recall: to bring something back into your mind.

An example:

Take five seconds and memorize this character: 海

Now clear your mind and scroll down until the character is hidden.










Do you think you'd be able to draw that character now? Every stroke perfectly - all the angles and dots and curves?

Of course not, unless you're special or know Chinese. That character is in my Chinese name, and I can't recall how to draw it - because I don't need to.

Now, can you pick the character out from this list?

还 海 害 嗨 骸 骇 駭

That seems easier, right? That's how I learned to write Chinese. When you're writing in Chinese on a phone or computer, you type the spoken word, then a list of possible characters come up and you pick the right one. I never write English, so I figured I'd never write Chinese, and so I was able to reduce the amount of memorization I had to do by ~20% (finger-in-air estimate). I only memorized recalling the spoken word and recognizing the written characters.

## Recall vs. recognition using LLMs

With the technique I described, I was able to learn Chinese much faster than otherwise. That said, at some point my Chinese proficiency would be held back by my inability to recall characters. That point comes far down the journey of learning the language.

This same concept applies to *all* the things that LLMs seem to be useful for. The learning curve for a huge set of tasks has changed because if you can structure the task right, you can turn it into an exercise in recognition rather than recall. This is a kind of obvious conclusion, but hopefully it's now nailed into you: **there are some tasks where you can become proficient faster if you perform them with the help of LLMs.**

In this same vein is the infamous "Stack Overflow" method of yester-decade. It applied to certain kinds of software development problem (package installations, exotic error codes, etc.). You'd Google your error message, click on the first couple Stack Overflow links, look at a couple solutions, then copy-paste the one that looked best. The alternative would be to understand what was really going on, but that wasn't worth the effort most of the time (right up until it was worth the effort).

It's not a new phenomenon, it has just expanded/exploded with LLMs. So how can we take advantage of it? *Recognize* where the recall-recognition tradeoff has suddenly shifted and where it hasn't.

Here are some examples in writing and programming...

Of where it has shifted:
- Producing early drafts of anything, given an outline or requirements.
- Giving feedback on drafts of content.

Of where it hasn't shifted:
- Writing the requirements, outline, or intent of a piece of work.
- Composing content into a final piece of work.
- Evaluating whether the work will succeed or fail.
- Things that can't be digitalized.

But there are more...
