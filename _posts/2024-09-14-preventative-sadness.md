> I once was a man who was often sad,<br>
> I cried each time I met someone new.

> So that when a friend<br>

> my cry was already sung.<br>
> 
> I was free to love,<br>
> attachments released,<br>
> my friends were already dead.

## Notes

"*Min-maxing* isÂ the character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character and minimizing everything else, seen as undesirable. The result is a character who is excessively powerful in one particular way, but exceedingly weak in others."
