There once was an eagle who commissioned an army of beavers to build a great dam to divert a river. They started in the summer, and the beavers built busily underwater. When fall came around and the dam was not yet built, the eagle assembled the beavers and explained,

"If we do not build the dam by winter, ice floes will sweep it away. We must work harder."

The beavers built even more busily. The eagle couldn't see them building underwater - the eagle could only see them when they came up for resources and coordination. The eagle screeched at them and some became energized. And then some collapsed in exhaustion. And then some fought with one-another.

A spokesbeaver said to the eagle,
"We can't work any harder."

"We must."
replied the eagle.

And then some of the best beavers left to go build a dam elsewhere. The dam finished two months before winter, but when the ice floes came, part of the dam collapsed. It was not well-built and half of the water escaped.

A few years later, the eagle commissioned an experienced army of beavers to build a great dam to divert another river. They started in the summer, and the beavers built busily underwater. Fall came around and there was no dam, so the eagle assembled the beavers and explained,

"If we do not build the dam by winter, ice floes will sweep it away. We must work harder."

A spokesbeaver replied,
"We know how hard we can work. We're working as hard as we can."

"I trust your judgement. Can you work smarter, then? We don't want the dam to collapse."
said the eagle.

"We will work our smartest."
said the spokesbeaver.

The beavers kept working, but up on land they mostly looked content. There was no high energy or exhaustion or fighting because such feelings were below them. Some of the best beavers left to go build a dam elsewhere. Winter came, there was no dam, and whatever had been made underwater washed away.

A few years later, the eagle commissioned an army of beavers to build a great dam to divert another river. In the past few years beavers had learned how to live and work underwater. They collected building materials underwater and slept in their dams underwater. Just a few spokesbeavers came above water to meet with the eagle, so the eagle rarely saw the army of beavers anymore. Fall came around and the dam was not yet done, so the eagle got all the beavers to swim up to the surface and explained,

"If we do not build the dam by winter, ice floes will sweep it away. We need more intensity."

The spokesbeaver responded,
"You can't see what we're doing underwater. We *are* productive. We're much more productive down there."

"Can you guarantee that the dam will be ready before winter?"
asked the eagle.

"No one can predict that."
said the spokesbeaver.

"Then we need more intensity."
said the eagle.

 "Or you must join us underwater."
 said the spokesbeaver.

The beavers were left to wonder how to surface their underwater activity.
The eagle was left to ponder whether it was willing to risk drowning for the dam.
