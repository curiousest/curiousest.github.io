## The argument: are we masters or slaves of the universe?

A brain-body is conscious. When its beliefs change, its perceived reality changes. Smaller pieces of the brain-body can cause large shifts in the wider brain's beliefs and perception of reality. The laws that seem to govern their reality changes.

What is/isnâ€™t physically included in that conscious brain-body is fuzzy. Brain-bodies can combine or assimilate, to make bigger conscious things.

Bigger or smaller things than the "traditional", singular human being can be conscious. Let's call them "pa-vessels" (panpsych agent vessel). When a pa-vessel changes its brain-body and beliefs, the their perception of reality changes. The laws that seem to govern their reality change. Smaller pieces of the pa-vessel can cause the wider pa-vessel to change its perceived reality and laws.

A pa-vessel approaching the size of the universe can be conscious. When that universe-sized pa-vessel changes its brain-body and beliefs, the its perception of reality changes. The laws that seem to govern its reality changes. Smaller pieces of the pa-vessel can cause the wider ps-vessel to change its perceived reality and laws.

Therefore we humans can change the laws of the universe. Or we can't. Both ways sound far-fetched. Reality falls somewhere in between, life survives somewhere in-between. We are neither masters nor slaves, so we are both masters and slaves.

## Why argue?

We tend to imagine the universe as having static phenomena. Perhaps physically expanding, with unchanging laws. But like human laws, universal laws are made-up. These laws are a product of the physical thing that "thinks" them up.

This argument is reimagining the universe as a brain, and universal laws as things that the universe "thinks". So laws can change (with a lot of effort) or be created (where it makes sense to). As opposed to exclusively being discovered - which would imply a static, comprehensible universe.
