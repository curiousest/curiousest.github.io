I've never seen a good product manager in an AI company.

I've seen good founders and executives, I've seen good domain experts and salespeople, I've seen good engineering and research leaders.

I've never seen a good product manager.

I think product managers are the glue you throw at the defects in your org structure. The more product managers in anÂ organization, the more it's held together with glue. Cutting-edge tech is guaranteed to be sketchy and glue won't fix mislaid foundations or a garbage GTM.
