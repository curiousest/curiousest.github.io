# meditations

Wow, incredible first chapter.
## first meditation 

I knew I had false beliefs that underpinned everything, and now I have the time to reconsider all of them.

I will disprove them all by disproving underlying principles that they’re all based on.

Senses can’t be trusted because they have been false before.

We never know whether we’re dreaming.

In dreams or reality, there are universals that we accept, like colour, magnitude, time, etc.

How do we know that god actually made those things real?

It might be good for him to deceive me.

Even if god is good, I should figure this stuff out.

I have to take care about using my beliefs.

Suppose some evil powerful spirit is tricking me.

It’s scary to consider, and I’m drawn back to my beliefs.

## second meditation

I’m scared, but I just need one foundation to build everything on.

Maybe nothing is certain.

I can’t be convinced that I don’t exist, so I must.

I can’t be sure of what this “I” is.

I have a mind and a body, the body is bounded by senses.

A demon could trick me into believing anything except that I’m thinking - which is part of my soul.

I can’t imagine what I am, because imaginations are illusions.

I am a thinking, perceiving thing.

That I perceive things, seems to be part of me, even if those perceptions are false.

Bodily things are easier to bound as a thing, but they’re more likely to be false.

The before and after of melting wax makes it different across all senses, but we say it’s the same thing.

Perception is beyond senses, and its what we use to identify the body of a thing.

Our senses don’t identity things - it’s perception from inspecting the senses.

Something about humans and animals…?

My mind perceives things, and I know my mind exists, so I have some evidence about those things.

## third meditation 

I know that I think and perceive.

Everything that I can clearly and distinctly perceive must be true.

I was perceiving something else when I observed a thing, before my first meditation.

For there to be a deceitful god, god must be a possibility.

Categorizing things, there is ideas and judgements.

Ideas can’t be false, but the judgement that an idea accurately models reality can be false.

I don’t know the true source of the ideas in my mind.

The things outside don’t seem to depend on me, they seem to transmit their own likeness.

“Taught by nature” is more spontaneous than a guiding light.

Maybe those external ideas come from something separate inside of me.

The idea of the sun from the senses seems to be less “like it” than the idea of the sun from notions of astronomic reasoning.

All these ideas are a result of some mechanisms inside of me, not through pure judgement.

There’s three levels of objective reality of ideas: less, some, infinite.

Something of objective reality must be caused by something of equal or greater reality.

The objective reality of an idea greater than me must not be me, so that thing must exist outside of me.

Different points on the same spectrum (ex hot vs cold) don’t seem to be very real.

These unclear, unreal things seem to derive from me.

Substances seem to have the same level of reality.

I can think of an infinitely powerful substance, but I am not at that level, therefore god.

An infinite substance must come before a finite one.

God seems to be the clearest and most distinct.

Maybe I’m proceeding incrementally to becoming god.

Continually incrementing doesn’t bring you to becoming god.

48 How can I exist and think of a perfect being?

I can only derive from myself or God.

If I was derived from myself, how could I have this idea of God?
