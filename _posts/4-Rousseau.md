## the social contract

### book 1

Chapter 1

Everyone seems to be enslaved. I don't know how it happened, but I think I can make it better.

People are better off not being forced to obey. But social order is useful.

Chapter 2

Family is the only natural society, and the master-slave dynamic must last as long as children need their father to survive.

The first law of man is self-preservation.

Family is the first political model to look at. But in it, a ruler can not love all his people.

There's a point of view where the ruler is a shepherd of a flock to care for so they can be consumed. With this point of view, rulers are gods and men are beasts. It can work this way, but it's an aftereffect of the dynamic, as opposed to the best way for things to be.

Chapter 3

There's no duty involved in "might is right."

There's not much point in obeying the strongest if they're "right" only for as long as they're strongest. They're not actually "right" in the true sense of the word.

Chapter 4

Conventions form the basis of all legitimate authority.

It doesn't make sense for people to give themselves to another. It's not "right".

To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man.

One might say that slavery is better than being killed in war, but war is an absurd and unnatural byproduct of feudalism, which isn't "right" in the first place.

Wars are between states, so states shouldn't kill people who aren't bearing arms for a state. When a state has won, the people of the lost state shouldn't be threatened with death.

Slave and "right" contradict each other.

Chapter 5

When a people gives itself to a king, it is a people before it is ruled by that king. And when the king dies, it is a people not ruled by that king. Becoming a people is worth more inspection than a people becoming ruled. And it all presupposes some sort of unanimous vote.
