I achieve my goals when I find the right habits to change and the default choices for those habits are good ones. Sometimes I fail at a goal because of my habits. I either didn't figure out what habits I needed to change or I barely invested in them.

---

- the long-term return is high and inspiring
- so that I can think, "this is my life now"
- so that I make time for it
- the default choices for the habit are good, so that when my willpower is low, I still make the correct decisions


The key considerations for the diet were:
- eat at the same time every day
- eat the same # of calories every day
- every meal comes from a list (1/10 days I eat a meal that doesn't come from the list)
-> groceries are repeatable (easy to re-order online or be in grocery store. You look at what's running low and get more. You don't eat anything else, so there's little temptation or opportunity for weakness.)
- say "no" to people trying to make you eat other things
- don't drink calories (alcohol, soft drinks, etc)

Everything I consume (except for that one meal every ten days or so) is from a preapproved list, so my defaults are perfect. I have minimal decision-making overhead about food - the hardest decision I have to make is, "which of these two meals will I eat right now?". The meals are the easiest options available to me - it would be more time and energy-consuming to order delivery food, find unhealthy food, or go out to eat. It's so much easier to stay on course when the most convenient option is by far the best.

Correct defaults:

Low time and decision making overhead
low activation energy

## Tiny habits
Option A:  Have an epiphany
Option B:  Change your environment
Option C:  Take baby steps

Creating an epiphany is difficult. So rule out Option A unless you have magical powers—I don’t.  

A trigger, or cue. (anchor)
A routine. (behavior - motivation + ability + prompt)
A reward (celebration)

On the other hand, Option B and Option C are practical. And they can lead to lasting change if you follow the right program.

debugging this habit:

Change the trigger — maybe ‘right before I go to sleep, while on bed’ is a bad time to slot in a new habit.
Simplify the action — ‘take up my kindle’ is the smallest version of this action already, so there’s not much to do here.
Celebrate when I’ve picked up the kindle but not read anything — this is acceptance that I can’t do it every night; but creates a reward in order to keep the habit loop going

## Atomic habits

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying

There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity. 

“Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.”

“One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.”

“Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.”

“It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.”

“People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”

“It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.”

“One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.”

“Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.”

“Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.”

Habit tracking, accountability partner, align habits with natural ability.

Trigger for improving a habit is regret from the habit failing.

- Make article about inducing inspiration and meta-habits (habits for creating habits)
- Don't be so pretentious

Trigger more obvious for good habit, less obvious for bad habit. ex:
- alarm
- delete bad stuff from your phone home screen

“One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.”

Doing good habit is easy, doing bad habit harder:
- put up barriers on bad thing
- take down barriers on good thing

Start extremely small and build up. Pick habits that align with ability.

“Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.”

“Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.”

“One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.”
