## Parable of good and evil

start from small thing - it tries to do something "good". One level higher identifies that smaller thing as being accidentally evil. Alternate between original thing lives or dies. Be less destruction-oriented? (like the last one) Instead, allocate resources/technology where they just don't grow as much or get to do the thing they want.


A child must???

A family leader must???

A community must (obvious trolley problem).

A nation must sacrifice a community to appease a warring nation.

A species must reduce its population to 20%. Warring nations not part of decision because they're busy.

A planet must destroy another planet.

A federation of species must destroy a solar system.

A tech-advanced species finds a way to optimize happiness. Eliminate suffering. Must neutralize a galaxy federation.

My creation. They haven't been following the purpose I set out for them. They can not know that purpose, but I have been giving signs of the behaviours they should have and the direction they should go. They are lost to that purpose now, so I will rain down armageddon, then remake them.

All of existence observed the heavens, the hells, and the Gods of each faith. Those heavens and hells are consuming resources at an exponential rate. They do not bring greater chances of continued existence, only reduce it. Their waste will bring the destruction of all of existence - heaven and hell included. Without existence, those Gods won't be able to pursue their arbitrary other purposes. The waste has become suboptimal... Evil. I will have a word with them.

What do people really believe in God? They believe there's some power with intent, God. They believe that God has some purpose that is not explained or explainable. They believe that God will provide incentives or punishments for following/not following that purpose. They believe that the purpose you must direct your behaviour towards is suggested by acts that occur outside of the view of science.
